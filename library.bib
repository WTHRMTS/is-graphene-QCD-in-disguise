abstract = {This work presents a method of grouping the electron spinors and the phonon modes of metal oxide crystals such as vanadium dioxide into an SU(2) gauge theory. The gauge “charge” is the electron spin, which is assumed to couple to the transverse acoustic phonons on the basis of spin ordering phenomena in M 1- and M 2-VO 2, while the longitudinal mode is neutral. A generalization of the Peierls Mechanism is presented based on the discrete gauge invariance of crystals and the corresponding Ward-Takahashi identity. The introduction of a band index results in violation of this discrete Ward-Takahashi identity for interband transitions, resulting in scattering from the longitudinal component. Thus both the spinors and the bosons acquire mass and an electronic band gap and optical phonon modes result: a symmetry-breaking metal-insulator transition, which can manifest concurrent spin-ordering.},

abstract = {The precise nature of unconventional superconductivity (SC) in iron pnictides is presently a hotly debated issue. Here, using insights from normal state electronic structure and symmetry arguments, we show how an unconventional SC emerges from the bad metal "normal" state. Short-ranged, multiband spin and charge correlations generate nodeless SC in the active planar d(xz,yz) bands, and an interband proximity effect induces out-of-plane gap nodes in the passive d(3z)(2)-r(2) band. While very good quantitative agreement with various key observations in the SC state and reconciliation with NMR and penetration depth data in the same picture are particularly attractive features of our proposal, clinching evidence would be an experimental confirmation of c-axis nodes in future work.},

With increasing temperature, the nanobeams transformed from the insulating monoclinic M(1) phase to a mixture of the Mott-insulating M(2) and metallic rutile phases. Domain fractions were used to extract the temperature dependent resistivity of the M(2) phase, which showed an activated behavior consistent with the expected Mott-Hubbard gap. Metallic monoclinic phases were also produced by direct injection of charge into devices, decoupling the Mott metal-insulator transition from the monoclinic to rutile structural phase transition.},

In this work, we examine this novel two-dimensional material from first principles. We find an instability towards the formation of an incommensurate charge-density-wave (CDW) and establish the star-of-David phase as the most stable commensurate CDW. The mottness in the star-of-David phase is confirmed and studied at various levels of theory: the spin-polarized generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and its extension involving the on-site Coulomb repulsion (GGA+$U$), as well as the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). Finally, we estimate Heisenberg exchange couplings in this material and find a weak nearest-neighbour ferromagnetic coupling, at odds with most Mott insulators. We point out the close resemblance between this star-of-David phase and flat-band ferromagnetism models.},

(2) A simple correction formula goes beyond the linear approximation of matrix elements within the tetrahedra and also improves the results for metals significantly. For a required accuracy this reduces the number of k points by orders of magnitude. (3) Irreducible k points and tetrahedra are selected by a fully automated procedure, requiring as input only the space-group operations. (4) The integration is formulated as a weighted sum over irreducible k points with integration weights calculated using the tetrahedron method once for a given band structure. This allows an e{%}cient use of the tetrahedron method also in plane-wave-based electronic-structure methods.},

@article{Schwinger1949,
abstract = {The discussion of vacuum polarization in the previous paper of this series was confined to that produced by the field of a prescribed current distribution. We now consider the induction of current in the vacuum by an electron, which is a dynamical system and an entity indistinguishable from the particles associated with vacuum fluctuations. The additional current thus attributed to an electron implies an alteration in its electromagnetic properties which will be revealed by scattering in a Coulomb field and by energy level displacements. This paper is concerned with the computation of the second-order corrections to the current operator and the application to electron scattering. Radiative corrections to energy levels will be treated in the next paper of the series. Following a canonical transformation which effectively renormalizes the electron mass, the correction to the current operator produced by the coupling with the electromagnetic field is developed in a power series, of which first- and second-order terms are retained. One thus obtains second-order modifications in the current operator which are of the same general nature as the previously treated vacuum polarization current, save for a contribution that has the form of a dipole current. The latter implies a fractional increase of $\alpha$/2$\pi$ in the spin magnetic moment of the electron. The only flaw in the second-order current correction is a logarithmic divergence attributable to an infra-red catastrophe. It is remarked that, in the presence of an external field, the first-order current correction will introduce a compensating divergence. Thus, the second-order corrections to particle electromagnetic properties cannot be completely stated without regard for the manner of exhibiting them by an external field. Accordingly, we consider in the second section the interaction of three systems, the matter field, the electromagnetic field, and a given current distribution. It is shown that this situation can be described in terms of an external potential coupled to the current operator, as modified by the interaction with the vacuum electromagnetic field. Application is made to the scattering of an electron by an external field, in which the latter is regarded as a small perturbation. It is found convenient to calculate the total rate at which collisions occur and then identify the cross sections for individual events. The correction to the cross section for radiationless scattering is determined by the second-order correction to the current operator, while scattering that is accompanied by single quantum emission is a consequence of the first-order current correction. The final object of calculation is the differential cross section for scattering through a given angle with a prescribed maximum energy loss, which is completely free of divergences. Detailed evaluations are given in two situations, the essentially elastic scattering of an electron, in which only a small fraction of the kinetic energy is radiated, and the scattering of a slowly moving electron with unrestricted energy loss. The Appendix is devoted to an alternative treatment of the polarization of the vacuum by an external field. The conditions imposed on the induced current by the charge conservation and gauge invariance requirements are examined. It is found that the fulfillment of these formal properties requires the vanishing of an integral that is not absolutely convergent, but naturally vanishes for reasons of symmetry. This null integral is then used to simplify the expression for the induced current in such a manner that direct calculation yields a gauge invariant result. The induced current contains a logarithmically divergent multiple of the external current, which implies that a non-vanishing total charge, proportional to the external charge, is induced in the vacuum. The apparent contradiction with charge conservation is resolved by showing that a compensating charge escapes to infinity. Finally, the expression for the electromagnetic mass of the electron is treated with the methods developed in this paper.},

abstract = {The ability to synthesize VO2 in the form of single-crystalline nanobeams and nano- and microcrystals uncovered a number of previously unknown aspects of the metal-insulator transition (MIT) in this oxide. In particular, several reports demonstrated that the MIT can proceed through competition between two monoclinic (insulating) phases M1 and M2 and the tetragonal (metallic) R phase under influence of strain. The nature of such phase behavior has been not identified. Here we show that the competition between M1 and M2 phases is purely lattice-symmetry-driven. Within the framework of the Ginzburg-Landau formalism, both M phases correspond to different directions of the same four-component structural order parameter, and as a consequence, the M2 phase can appear under a small perturbation of the M1 structure such as doping or stress. We analyze the strain-controlled phase diagram of VO2 in the vicinity of the R-M2-M1 triple point using the Ginzburg-Landau formalism and identify and experimentally verify the pathways for strain-control of the transition. These insights open the door toward more systematic approaches to synthesis of VO2 nanostructures in desired phase states and to use of external fields in the control of the VO2 phase states. Additionally, we report observation of the triclinic T phase at the heterophase domain boundaries in strained quasi-two-dimensional VO2 nanoplatelets, and theoretically predict phases that have not been previously observed.},

These models are related by two duality transformations. The models with 1 < n < d exhibit a phase transition without local order parameter. A nonanalyticity in the specific heat and a different qualitative behavior of certain spin correlation functions in the low and the high temperature phases indicate the existence of a phase transition. The Hamiltonian of the simple cubic dual model contains products of four Ising spin operators. Applying a star square transformation, one obtains an Ising model with competing interactions exhibiting a singularity in the specific heat but no long‐range order of the spins in the low temperature phase.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {It is argued that the wave function representing an excitation in liquid helium should be nearly of the form $\Sigma$if(ri)$\phi$, where $\phi$ is the ground-state wave function, f(r) is some function of position, and the sum is taken over each atom i. In the variational principle this trial function minimizes the energy if f(r)=exp(ik{{{\textperiodcentered}}}r), the energy value being E(k)=ℏ2k2/2mS(k), where S(k) is the structure factor of the liquid for neutron scattering. For small k, E rises linearly (phonons). For larger k, S(k) has a maximum which makes a ring in the diffraction pattern and a minimum in the E(k) vs k curve. Near the minimum, E(k) behaves as $\Delta$+ℏ2(k-k0)2/2$\mu$, which form Landau found agrees with the data on specific heat. The theoretical value of $\Delta$ is twice too high, however, indicating need of a better trial function. Excitations near the minimum are shown to behave in all essential ways like the rotons postulated by Landau. The thermodynamic and hydrodynamic equations of the two-fluid model are discussed from this view. The view is not adequate to deal with the details of the $\lambda$ transition and with problems of critical flow velocity. In a dilute solution of He3 atoms in He4, the He3 should move essentially as free particles but of higher effective mass. This mass is calculated, in an appendix, to be about six atomic mass units.},

abstract = {The optical constants of VO2 have been determined between 0.25 and 5 eV both below and above the semiconductor-metal transition temperature Tt=340°K. Reflectivity and transmission spectra have been measured on both single crystals and than films. The reflectivity spectra of the bulk crystals were measured with E ⊥ (c axis) in the tetragonal phase [or ⊥ (a axis) in the monoclinic phase], and with E parallel to these axes. While there are some differences in magnitude between the dielectric constants obtained from thin-film and single-crystal measurements, the structural features are in good agreement. Below Tt there are four prominent absorption peaks centered near photon energies of 0.85, 1.3, 2.8, and 3.6 eV. Above Tt, metallic free-carrier absorption is observed below 2.0 eV, but the same two absorption peaks near 3 and 4 eV are present. The energy location and polarization dependence of these two higher energy peaks can be related to similar absorption peaks in rutile, and are interpreted using the rutile band structure. The results are consistent with a picture in which filled bands arising primarily from oxygen 2p orbitals are separated by approximately 2.5 eV from partially filled bands arising primarily from vanadium 3d orbitals. Transitions from the filled 2p bands are responsible for the high-energy peaks in the optical absorption in both the high- and low-temperature phases. In the high-temperature metallic phase, there is evidence that there is overlap among the 3d bands such that at least two bands are partially occupied by the extra d electron per vanadium ion. In the low-temperature semiconductor phase, a band gap of approximately 0.6 eV opens up within the 3d bands, separating two filled bands from higher-lying empty bands. The two absorption peaks at 0.85 and 1.3 eV are due to transitions from these two filled bands.},

It is well known that such a metal has a superconducting instability induced by the formation of spin-singlet pairs of electrons, with the pairing amplitude changing sign between regions of the Fermi surface connected by the spin density wave ordering wavevector. Here we review recent arguments that there is an additional instability which is nearly as strong: towards the onset of a modulated bond order which is locally an Ising-nematic order. This new instability is a consequence of an emergent "pseudospin" symmetry of the low energy theory---the symmetry maps the sign-changing pairing amplitude to the bond order parameter.},

abstract = {A hydrodynamic theory of transport in quantum mechanically phase-disordered superconductors is possible when supercurrent relaxation can be treated as a slow process. We obtain general results for the frequency-dependent conductivity of such a regime. With time-reversal invariance, the conductivity is characterized by a Drude-like peak, with width given by the supercurrent relaxation rate. Using the memory matrix formalism, we obtain a formula for this width (and hence also the dc resistivity) when the supercurrent is relaxed by short range Coulomb interactions. This leads to a new -- effective field theoretic and fully quantum -- derivation of a classic result on flux flow resistance. With strong breaking of time-reversal invariance, the optical conductivity exhibits what we call a `hydrodynamic supercyclotron' resonance. We obtain the frequency and decay rate of this resonance for the case of supercurrent relaxation due to an emergent Chern-Simons gauge field. The supercurrent decay rate in this `topologically ordered superfluid vortex liquid' is determined by the conductivities of the normal component of the liquid. Our work gives a controlled framework for low temperature metallic phases arising from phase-disordered superconductivity.},

Sections 1–8 provide a self-contained introduction at a fairly elementary level to the statistical mechanical theory. No background is required except for some prior experience with diagrams. In particular, a diagrammatic approximation to an exact renormalization group equation is presented in sections 4 and 5; sections 6–8 include the approximate renormalization group recursion formula and the Feyman graph method for calculating exponents. Sections 10–13 go deeper into renormalization group theory (section 9 presents a calculation of anomalous dimensions). The equivalence of quantum field theory and classical statistical mechanics near the critical point is established in section 10; sections 11–13 concern problems common to both subjects. Specific field theoretic references assume some background in quantum field theory. An exact renormalization group equation is presented in section 11; sections 12 and 13 concern fundamental topological questions.},

By combining scanning tunneling microscopy measurements and first-principles calculations, we investigate the atomic scale electronic structure of the 1T-TaS 2 Mott insulator and its evolution to the metallic state upon isovalent substitution of S with Se. We identify two distinct types of orbital textures— one localized and the other extended—and demonstrate that the interplay between them is the key factor that determines the electronic structure. In particular, we show that the continuous evolution of the charge gap visualized by scanning tunneling microscopy is due to the immersion of the localized-orbital-induced Hubbard bands into the extended-orbital-spanned Fermi sea, featuring a unique evolution from a Mott gap to a charge-transfer gap. This new mechanism of Mottness collapse revealed here suggests an interesting route for creating novel electronic states and designing future electronic devices.},

In the last part, we discuss about an attempt to come up with a prescription to derive holographic theory for general quantum field theory.},

@article{Brinkman1973,
abstract = {In this paper the energetics of the formation of electron-hole metallic liquids in semiconductors is examined. The ground-state energies of electron-hole metals are calculated using Hubbard's approximate treatment of the electron gas for the following cases: (a) germanium, (b) germanium with a large (111) strain, (c) silicon, and (d) GaAs. The simple case of a single isotropic maximum for the valence band and a single minimum for the conduction band is also treated. It is shown that for both Si and Ge, the binding energy of the metallic state relative to free excitons is 5.7 and 1.7 meV, respectively. These values and the values of the equilibrium density are in good agreement with experiment. In the isotropic model the metallic state is not bound while for GaAs and strained Ge the metallic-state energy per electron is essentially equal to that for a gas of free excitons. The low-density limit of the isotropic band model is examined and the ground state for this system is predicted to be a dilute gas of molecules. It is argued that the forces between molecules are repulsive and will cause this state to break up at relatively low densities. If the density is increased, the system will undergo a first-order transition to the metallic state. The relevance of these calculations to the metal-insulator transition problem is discussed. It is pointed out that the fact that anisotropic and many-valleyed bands favor the metallic state means that the metal-insulator transition must ultimately be first order.},

Here we report site-resolved imaging of two-component fermionic Mott insulators, metals, and band insulators using ultracold atoms in a square lattice. We observe large, defect-free 2D Mott insulators for strong repulsive interactions. For intermediate interactions we observe a coexistence of phases. From comparison to theory we find trap-averaged entropies per particle of 1.0\,k_{\mathrm{B}} and local entropies as low as 0.5\,k_{\mathrm{B}}. This experiment is a vital step towards probing quantum-mechanical models in regimes inaccessible by modern theoretical methods.},

Here, using insights from normal state electronic structure and symmetry arguments, we show how an unconventional SC emerges from the bad metal "normal" state. Short-ranged, multiband spin and charge correlations generate nodeless SC in the active planar d(xz,yz) bands, and an interband proximity effect induces out-of-plane gap nodes in the passive d(3z)(2)-r(2) band. While very good quantitative agreement with various key observations in the SC state and reconciliation with NMR and penetration depth data in the same picture are particularly attractive features of our proposal, clinching evidence would be an experimental confirmation of c-axis nodes in future work.},

@article{Stoneham2003,
abstract = {Computing comprises three distinct strands: hardware, software and the ways they are used in real or imagined worlds. Its use in research is more than writing or running code. Having something significant to compute and deploying judgement in what is attempted and achieved are especially challenging. In science or engineering, one must define a central problem in computable form, run such software as is appropriate and, last but by no means least, convince others that the results are both valid and useful. These several strands are highly interdependent. A major scientific development can transform disparate aspects of information and computer technologies. Computers affect the way we do science, as well as changing our personal worlds. Access to information is being transformed, with consequences beyond research or even science. Creativity in research is usually considered uniquely human, with inspiration a central factor. Scientific and technological needs are major forces in innovation, and these include hardware and software opportunities. One can try to define the scientific needs for established technologies (atomic energy, the early semiconductor industry), for rapidly developing technologies (advanced materials, microelectronics) and for emerging technologies (nanotechnology, novel information technologies). Did these needs define new computing, or was science diverted into applications of then-available codes? Regarding credibility, why is it that engineers accept computer realizations when designing engineered structures, whereas predictive modelling of materials has yet to achieve industrial confidence outside very special cases? The tensions between computing and traditional science are complex, unpredictable and potentially powerful.},

A general formalism for calculating the instantaneous corre- lation between any two spins is developed and applied to the investigation of short- and long-range order. Both models show nonvanishing long-range order in the ground state for a range of values of a certain parameter $\lambda$which is analogous to an anisotropy parameter in the Heisenberg model. A detailed comparison with the Heisenberg model suggests that the latter has no long-range order in the isotropic case but finite long-range order for any finite amount of anisotropy. The unreliability of variational methods for determin- ing long-range order is emphasized. It is also shown that for spin 1/2 systems having rather general isotropic Heisenberg interactions favoring an antiferromagnetic ordering, the ground state is nondegenerate and there is no energy gap above the ground state in the energy spectrum of the total system.},

abstract = {This article presents a systematic theoretical enquiry concerning the conceptual foundations and the nature of phonon-mediated electron-electron interactions. Starting from the fundamental many-body Hamiltonian, we propose a simple scheme to decouple the electrons and nuclei of a crystalline solid via effective interactions. These effective interactions, which we express in terms of linear response functions, are completely symmetric between electrons and nuclei. Correspondingly, we derive concrete formulae for both the effective electron interaction mediated by phonons and the effective nuclear interaction mediated by electrons. In particular, we rederive from our fundamental ansatz the well-known general expressions of the effective electron-electron interaction in terms of the elastic Green function and the phonon dispersion relation. We further show that the effective nuclear interaction coincides in the instantaneous limit with the dynamical matrix as calculated in electronic structure theory. If combined with the Kubo formalism, our general formulae lend themselves to the calculation of effective interactions from first principles. By showing the compatibility of our approach with the functional integral formalism, this work also paves the way for the derivation of ab initio initial interactions for functional renormalization group applications.},

abstract = {The electrical resistance of single VO(2) nanobeams was measured while simultaneously mapping the domain structure with Raman spectroscopy to investigate the relationship between structural domain formation and the metal-insulator transition. With increasing temperature, the nanobeams transformed from the insulating monoclinic M(1) phase to a mixture of the Mott-insulating M(2) and metallic rutile phases. Domain fractions were used to extract the temperature dependent resistivity of the M(2) phase, which showed an activated behavior consistent with the expected Mott-Hubbard gap. Metallic monoclinic phases were also produced by direct injection of charge into devices, decoupling the Mott metal-insulator transition from the monoclinic to rutile structural phase transition.},

abstract = {The optical constants of methylammonium lead halide single crystals CH3NH3PbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) are interpreted with high level ab initio calculations using the relativistic quasiparticle self-consistent GW approximation (QSGW). Good agreement between the optical constants derived from QSGW and those obtained from spectroscopic ellipsometry enables the assignment of the spectral features to their respective inter-band transitions. We show that the transition from the highest valence band (VB) to the lowest conduction band (CB) is responsible for almost all the optical response of MAPbI3 between 1.2 and 5.5 eV (with minor contributions from the second highest VB and the second lowest CB). The calculations indicate that the orientation of [CH3NH3]+ cations has a significant influence on the position of the bandgap suggesting that collective orientation of the organic moieties could result in significant local variations of the optical properties. The optical constants and energy band diagram of CH3NH3PbI3 are then used to simulate the contributions from different optical transitions to a typical transient absorption spectrum (TAS).},

abstract = {A general Hamiltonian formalism is developed to treat from first principles the motion of electrons in solids, including their mutual Coulomb interaction. By a series of canonical transformations it is shown that under suitable circumstances (which obtain in nearly all solids) plasmons (a quantized collective plasma oscillation of the electron gas) represent a well-defined elementary excitation of the solid. The "existence criterion" for plasmons is found to be a high electronic polarizability. Where plasmons exist, we are able to give a satisfactory description of their properties when the majority of the individual electron oscillator strengths correspond to transitions in which the energy change is large or small with respect to the plasmon energy, ℏ$\omega$p=ℏ(4$\pi$Ne2/m)1/2. After the plasmon modes are separated out, the remaining electron interaction is found to be screened, with a range of the order of the interelectronic spacing. The usefulness of this effective Hamiltonian for the calculation of the electronic energy levels and cohesive energy in solids is discussed briefly.},

abstract = {We review the dynamical mean-field theory of strongly correlated electron systems which is based on a mapping of lattice models onto quantum impurity models subject to a self-consistency condition. This mapping is exact for models of correlated electrons in the limit of large lattice coordination (or infinite spatial dimensions). It extends the standard mean-field construction from classical statistical mechanics to quantum problems. We discuss the physical ideas underlying this theory and its mathematical derivation. Various analytic and numerical techniques that have been developed recently in order to analyze and solve the dynamical mean-field equations are reviewed and compared to each other. The method can be used for the determination of phase diagrams (by comparing the stability of various types of long-range order), and the calculation of thermodynamic properties, one-particle Green's functions, and response functions. We review in detail the recent progress in understanding the Hubbard model and the Mott metal-insulator transition within this approach, including some comparison to experiments on three-dimensional transition-metal oxides. We present an overview of the rapidly developing field of applications of this method to other systems. The present limitations of the approach, and possible extensions of the formalism are finally discussed. Computer programs for the numerical implementation of this method are also provided with this article.},

By examining its dependence on photon energy, polarization, sodium dosing and the counting of Fermi surface volume, both the bulk and the surface contributions are identified. We find that a bulk band moves toward high binding energies below structural transition, and shifts smoothly across the spin density wave transition by about 25 meV. Our data suggest the band reconstruction may play a crucial role in the spin density wave transition, and the structural transition is driven by the short range magnetic order. For the surface states, both the LaO-terminated and FeAs-terminated components are revealed. Certain small band shifts are verified for the FeAs-terminated surface states in the spin density wave state, which is a reflection of the bulk electronic structure reconstruction. Moreover, sharp quasiparticle peaks quickly rise at low temperatures, indicating of drastic reduction of the scattering rate. A kink structure in one of the surface band is shown to be possibly related to the electron-phonon interactions.},

We then propose a calculational technique for computing these states and their properties, where instead of topology we rely on a perturbative mechanism. It assumes that already before the topological mechanism can come into effect there is already a strong inclination of quarks to be confined. In particular the planar limit of large N QCD should exhibit this mechanism. By renormalizing the infrared divergence of one-loop diagrams, one may already realize a confining potential. In practice, our procedure will require gauge-fixing in advance, but it would be more elegant if, at an intermediate level, the theory with infrared counter terms included could be written as a gauge-invariant effective model. Models of the desired kind are described. They are not renormalizable, but they are local, gauge- and lorentz invariant.},

Principally, this is because DFT in the Kohn–Sham (KS) formalism offers the appealing combination of relatively high accuracy and relatively low computational cost. Despite their great successes, traditional semilocal functionals fail to describe some important problems in solid state physics and materials science, the most conspicuous example being the notorious band gap problem. More sophisticated functionals providing greater accuracy without sacrificing computational efficiency are therefore needed. The Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) screened hybrid density functional [J. Heyd, G. E. Scuseria, and M. Ernzerhof, J. Chem. Phys. 118, 8207 (2003); J. Heyd and G. E. Scuseria, J. Chem.

This work discusses some of the concepts underlying HSE and provides illustrative examples highlighting the successes of HSE in numerous solid state applications},

Within this scenario, the spin-fluctuations play a decisive role in formation of the fermionic excitation spectrum in the normal state and are sufficient to explain the high transition temperatures to the superconducting state while the pseudogap phenomenon is a consequence of a Peierls-type intrinsic instability of electronic system to formation of an incommensurate density wave.

Besides the mean particle number N$\Omega$ and mean square fluctuation ($\Delta$N$\Omega$)2=(N2)$\Omega$−(N$\Omega$)2, we also examine the full probability distribution P$\Omega$(N).

The solution of the s-wave Kondo Hamiltonian, describing a single magnetic impurity in a nonmagnetic metal, is explained in detail. See Secs. VII-IX. "Block spin" methods, applied to the two dimensional Ising model, are explained in Sec. VI. The first three sections give a relatively short review of basic renormalization group ideas, mainly in the context of critical phenomena. The relationship of the modern renormalization group to the older problems of divergences in statistical mechanics and field theory and field theoretic renormalization is discussed in Sec. IV. In Sec. V the special case of "marginal variables" is discussed in detail, along with the relationship of the modern renormalization group to its original formulation by Gell-Mann and Low and others.},

The main conceptual foundations are discussed in sections 2 and 3, which cover the momentum expansion and the most important issues associated with the renormalization process. Section 4 presents an overview of Chiral Perturbation Theory, the low-energy realization of Quantum Chromodynamics in the light quark sector. The Chiral Perturbation Theory framework is applied to weak transitions in section 5, where the physics of non-leptonic kaon decays is analyzed. The so-called Heavy Quark Effective Theory is briefly discussed in section 6. The electroweak chiral Effective Field Theory is described in section 7, which contains a brief overview of the effective Lagrangian associated with the spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking. Some summarizing comments are finally given in section 8.},

With increasing temperature, the nanobeams transformed from the insulating monoclinic M(1) phase to a mixture of the Mott-insulating M(2) and metallic rutile phases. Domain fractions were used to extract the temperature dependent resistivity of the M(2) phase, which showed an activated behavior consistent with the expected Mott-Hubbard gap. Metallic monoclinic phases were also produced by direct injection of charge into devices, decoupling the Mott metal-insulator transition from the monoclinic to rutile structural phase transition.},

@article{Jackson2001,
abstract = {Gauge invariance is the basis of the modern theory of electroweak and strong interactions (the so called Standard Model). The roots of gauge invariance go back to the year 1820 when electromagnetism was discovered and the first electrodynamic theory was proposed. Subsequent developments led to the discovery that different forms of the vector potential result in the same observable forces. The partial arbitrariness of the vector potential A brought forth various restrictions on it. div A = 0 was proposed by J. C. Maxwell; 4-div A = 0 was proposed L. V. Lorenz in the middle of 1860's . In most of the modern texts the latter condition is attributed to H. A. Lorentz, who half a century later was one of the key figures in the final formulation of classical electrodynamics. In 1926 a relativistic quantum-mechanical equation for charged spinless particles was formulated by E. Schrodinger, O. Klein, and V. Fock. The latter discovered that this equation is invariant with respect to multiplication of the wave function by a phase factor exp(ieX/hc) with the accompanying additions to the scalar potential of -dX/cdt and to the vector potential of grad X. In 1929 H. Weyl proclaimed this invariance as a general principle and called it Eichinvarianz in German and gauge invariance in English. The present era of non-abelian gauge theories started in 1954 with the paper by C. N. Yang and R. L. Mills.},

We contrast the physical picture of Mott, who emphasized the role of electron-electron interactions, and that of Anderson, who stressed the possibility of impurity-induced bound state formation, as alternative routes to arrest the electronic motion. We also describe more complicated situations when both phenomena play coexist, leading to meta-stability, slow relaxation, and glassy behavior of electrons. A critical overview of the available theoretical approaches is then presented, contrasting the weak-coupling perspective, which emphasizes diffusion-mode corrections, and the strong-coupling viewpoint, which stresses inhomogeneous phases and local correlation effects. We give specific examples of experimental systems, providing clues on what should be the most profitable path forward in unraveling the mystery of metal-insulator transitions.},

To investigate this situation a simple, approximate model for the interaction of electrons in narrow energy bands is introduced. The results of applying the Hartree-Fock approximation to this model are examined. Using a Green function technique an approximate solution of the correlation problem for this model is obtained. This solution has the property of reducing to the exact atomic solution in the appropriate limit and to the ordinary uncorrelated band picture in the opposite limit. The condition for ferromagnetism of this solution is discussed. To clarify the physical meaning of the solution a two-electron example is examined.},

abstract = {The metal-insulator transition in correlated materials is usually coupled to a symmetry-lowering structural phase transition. This coupling not only complicates the understanding of the basic mechanism of this phenomenon but also limits the speed and endurance of prospective electronic devices. We demonstrate an isostructural, purely electronically driven metal-insulator transition in epitaxial heterostructures of an archetypal correlated material, vanadium dioxide. A combination of thin-film synthesis, structural and electrical characterizations, and theoretical modeling reveals that an interface interaction suppresses the electronic correlations without changing the crystal structure in this otherwise correlated insulator. This interaction stabilizes a nonequilibrium metallic phase and leads to an isostructural metal-insulator transition. This discovery will provide insights into phase transitions of correlated materials and may aid the design of device functionalities.},

We show that electrolyte gating of epitaxial thin films of VO(2) suppresses the metal-to-insulator transition and stabilizes the metallic phase to temperatures below 5 kelvin, even after the ionic liquid is completely removed. We found that electrolyte gating of VO(2) leads not to electrostatically induced carriers but instead to the electric field-induced creation of oxygen vacancies, with consequent migration of oxygen from the oxide film into the ionic liquid. This mechanism should be taken into account in the interpretation of ionic liquid gating experiments.},

abstract = {We analyze a mean-field model of electrons with pure forward scattering interactions on a square lattice which exhibits spontaneous Fermi surface symmetry breaking with a d-wave order parameter: the surface expands along the kx-axis and shrinks along the ky-axis (or vice versa). The symmetry-broken phase is stabilized below a dome-shaped transition line Tc(mu), with a maximal Tc near van Hove filling. The phase transition is usually first order at the edges of the transition line, and always second order around its center. The d-wave compressibility of the Fermi surface is however strongly enhanced even near the first order transition down to zero temperature. In the weak coupling limit the phase diagram is fully determined by a single non-universal energy scale, and hence dimensionless ratios of different characteristic quantities are universal. Adding a uniform repulsion to the forward scattering interaction, the two tricritical points at the ends of the second order transition line are shifted to lower temperatures. For a particularly favorable choice of hopping and interaction parameters one of the first order edges is replaced completely by a second order transition line, leading to a quantum critical point.},

abstract = {Correlated electron materials can undergo a variety of phase transitions, including superconductivity, the metal-insulator transition and colossal magnetoresistance. Moreover, multiple physical phases or domains with dimensions of nanometres to micrometres can coexist in these materials at temperatures where a pure phase is expected. Making use of the properties of correlated electron materials in device applications will require the ability to control domain structures and phase transitions in these materials. Lattice strain has been shown to cause the coexistence of metallic and insulating phases in the Mott insulator VO(2). Here, we show that we can nucleate and manipulate ordered arrays of metallic and insulating domains along single-crystal beams of VO(2) by continuously tuning the strain over a wide range of values. The Mott transition between a low-temperature insulating phase and a high-temperature metallic phase usually occurs at 341 K in VO(2), but the active control of strain allows us to reduce this transition temperature to room temperature. In addition to device applications, the ability to control the phase structure of VO(2) with strain could lead to a deeper understanding of the correlated electron materials in general.},

Here, we demonstrate a dramatic change over a spectral range of hundreds of meV on the femtosecond timescale in the optical response of atomically thin two-dimensional crystals of the transition-metal dichalcogenide WS2 following excitation by intense optical pump pulses. Our findings reveal the role of extremely strong Coulomb interactions. At the direct gap, we observe a Mott transition from excitonic states to free carriers, accompanied by a giant bandgap renormalization of approximately 500 meV and the development of population inversion.},

abstract = {This review gives a rather general discussion of high temperature superconductors as an example of a strongly correlated material. The argument is made that in view of the many examples of unconventional superconductors discovered in the past twenty years, we should no longer be surprised that superconductivity emerges as a highly competitive ground state in systems where Coulomb repulsion plays a dominant role. The physics of the cuprates is discussed, emphasizing the unusual pseudogap phase in the underdoped region. It is argued that the resonating valence bond (RVB) picture, as formulated using gauge theory with fermionic and bosonic matter fields, gives an adequate physical understanding, even though many details are beyond the powers of current calculational tools. The recent discovery of quantum oscillations in a high magnetic field is discussed in this context. Meanwhile, the problem of the quantum spin liquid (a spin system with antiferromagnetic coupling which refuses to order even at zero temperature) is a somewhat simpler version of the high {$}T{_}c{$} problem where significant progress has been made recently. It is understood that the existence of matter fields can lead to de-confinement of the U(1) gauge theory in 2+1 dimensions, and novel new particles (called fractionalized particles), such as fermionic spinons which carry spin {$}{{}1\backslashover 2{}}{$} and no charge, and gapless gauge bosons can emerge to create a new critical state at low energies. We even have a couple of real materials where such a scenario may be realized experimentally. The article ends with answers to questions such as: what limits {$}T{_}c{$} if pairing is driven by an electronic energy scale? why is the high {$}T{_}c{$} problem hard? why is there no consensus? and why is the high {$}T{_}c{$} problem important?},

@article{Vinson2013,
abstract = {X-ray spectroscopy is a powerful and widely used tool for the investigation of the electronic structure of a large variety of solid-state materials, including crystals, liquids, amorphous solids, molecules, and extended states such as clusters or interfaces. The local nature of x-ray mediated electronic excitations, involving transitions to or from localized, atomic-like, core levels, makes them ideal probes of local electronic properties: bonding character, charge transfer, and local geometry. The interpretation of spectra relies on modeling the excitations accurately to provide a concrete connection between specific properties of a system and the resulting x-ray spectrum. As experimental techniques and facilities have improved, including third generation synchrotron sources and the advent of x-ray free-electron lasers, measurements have been taken on wider ranges of systems, exploring the effects of temperature and pressure, and at higher resolutions than before, but theoretical techniques have lagged. Our goal is to develop a first-principles the- oretical framework capable of achieving quantitative agreement with x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) experiments. This thesis aims to develop the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE), a particle-hole Green's function method, for describing the excited electronic state produced in core-level x-ray absorption and related spectroscopies. Building upon density functional the- ory along with self-energy corrections, our approach provides connection to experiment with minimal adjustable parameters, to both aid in interpretation and highlight unaccounted for phys- ical processes. While a fully parameter-free method for calculating x-ray spectroscopy remains elusive, our method presented here allows for quantitative comparison to experiment without system-dependent fits. This method has been implemented in the OCEAN software package, and results are presented for both insulating and metallic materials, including 3d transition metal and water systems.},

In Section 2, we will derive these Hedin equations from a Feynman-diagrammatical point of view. Section 3.1 shows how GW arises as an approximation to the Hedin equations. In Section 3.2, we briefly present some typical GW results for materials, including quasiparticle renormalizations, lifetimes, and band gap enhancements. In Section 4, the combination of GW and DMFT is summarized. Finally, as a prospective outlook, ab initio dynamical vertex approximation D$\Gamma$A is introduced in Section 5 as a unifying scheme for all that: GW, DMFT and non-local vertex correlations beyond.},

abstract = {Stoichiometric LiFeAs at ambient pressure is an 18 K superconductor while isoelectronic MgFeGe is not, despite their extremely similar electronic structures. To investigate possible sources of this distinctively different superconducting behavior, we quantify the differences using first principles density functional theory, establishing first that the Fe total 3d occupations are identical in the two compounds. Individual 3d orbital occupations also differ very little ({$}\backslashsim 0.01{$}). The differences in Fermi surfaces (FSs) do not seem significant; however a redistribution of bands just above the Fermi level does represent a possibly significant distinction. Because the bands and FSs of LiFeAs are less in agreement with experiment than for other iron-pnictides, we study the effects of additional exchange-correlations effects beyond GGA (the generalized gradient approximation) by applying the modified Becke-Johnson potential (mBJ) exchange potential, which gives much improved bandgaps in insulators compared to GGA and might be useful for semimetals such as the Fe-based superconductors. Overall, we conclude that the mBJ corrections do not improve the description of LiFeAs as compared to experiment.},

abstract = {The mechanism of electron pairing in high-temperature superconductors is still the subject of intense debate. Here, we provide direct evidence of the role of structural dynamics, with selective atomic motions (buckling of copper-oxygen planes), in the anisotropic electron-lattice coupling. The transient structures were determined using time-resolved electron diffraction, following carrier excitation with polarized femtosecond heating pulses, and examined for different dopings and temperatures. The deformation amplitude reaches 0.5% of the c axis value of 30 A when the light polarization is in the direction of the copper-oxygen bond, but its decay slows down at 45 degrees. These findings suggest a selective dynamical lattice involvement with the anisotropic electron-phonon coupling being on a time scale (1-3.5 ps depending on direction) of the same order of magnitude as that of the spin exchange of electron pairing in the high-temperature superconducting phase.},

The interest for developing efficient methods is motivated by recent discoveries and characterizations of strongly correlated electron materials and by requirements for understanding mechanisms of intriguing phenomena beyond a single-particle picture. A three-stage scheme is developed as renormalized multi-scale solvers (RMS) utilizing the hierarchical electronic structure in the energy space. It provides us with an ab initio downfolding of the global band structure into low-energy effective models followed by low-energy solvers for the models. The RMS method is illustrated with examples of several materials. In particular, we overview cases such as dynamics of semiconductors, transition metals and its compounds including iron-based superconductors and perovskite oxides, as well as organic conductors of kappa-ET type.},

@article{Patridge2012,
abstract = {The substitutional doping of Mo within VO2 substantially alters the electronic and structural phase diagrams of the host lattice, most notably by bringing the technologically relevant metal-insulator phase transition temperature in closer proximity to room temperature. Here, we have used X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy at V and Mo K-edges to examine the local electronic and geometric structure of both the dopant atoms and the host lattice. A nominal Mo oxidation state of +5 has been determined, which implies electron doping of the VO2 band structure. In addition, XAFS studies suggest that doping with Mo creates locally symmetric domains that are more akin to the high-temperature rutile phase of VO2, thereby lowering activation energy barriers for structural transformation to the metallic phase. Substantial rectification of octahedral canting is also observed upon Mo doping, which has the effect of decreasing V 3d-O 2p hybridization and likely assists in closing the characteristic band gap of the low-temperature monoclinic phase. A correlated set of cationic interactions is seen to emerge with increasing Mo doping, which can be ascribed to local dimerization along the rutile c axis as has been proposed to be a characteristic structural feature of a correlated metallic phase with intermediate mass.},

Modulations of this distribution often occur when those electrons are not stable with respect to a new electronic order, such as spin or charge density waves. Electron density waves have been observed in many families of superconductors, and are often considered to be essential for superconductivity to exist. Recent measurements seem to show that the properties of the iron pnictides are in good agreement with band structure calculations that do not include additional ordering, implying no relation between density waves and superconductivity in these materials. Here we report that the electronic structure of Ba(1-x)K(x)Fe(2)As(2) is in sharp disagreement with those band structure calculations, and instead reveals a reconstruction characterized by a (pi, pi) wavevector. This electronic order coexists with superconductivity and persists up to room temperature (300 K).},

abstract = {Linear optical properties can be accurately calculated using the Bethe-Salpeter equation. After introducing a suitable product basis for the electron-hole pairs, the Bethe-Salpeter equation is usually recast into a complex non-Hermitian eigenvalue problem that is difficult to solve using standard eigenvalue solvers. In solid-state physics, it is therefore common practice to neglect the problematic coupling between the positive- and negative-frequency branches, reducing the problem to a Hermitian eigenvalue problem [Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA)]. We use time-inversion symmetry to recast the full problem into a quadratic Hermitian eigenvalue problem, which can be solved routinely using standard eigenvalue solvers even at a finite wave vector q. This allows us to access the importance of the coupling between the positive- and negative-frequency branch for prototypical solids. As a starting point for the Bethe-Salpeter calculations, we use self-consistent Green's-function methods (GW), making the present scheme entirely ab initio. We calculate the optical spectra of carbon (C), silicon (Si), lithium fluoride (LiF), and the cyclic dimer Li2F2 and discuss why the differences between the TDA and the full solution are tiny. However, at finite momentum transfer q, significant differences between the TDA and our exact treatment are found. The origin of these differences is explained.},

abstract = {Many theoretical models of high-temperature superconductivity focus only on the doping dependence of the CuO(2)-plane electronic structure. However, such models are manifestly insufficient to explain the strong variations in superconducting critical temperature, T(c), among cuprates that have identical hole density but are crystallographically different outside of the CuO(2) plane. A key challenge, therefore, has been to identify a predominant out-of-plane influence controlling the superconductivity, with much attention focusing on the distance d(A) between the apical oxygen and the planar copper atom. Here we report direct determination of how variations in interatomic distances within individual crystalline unit cells affect the superconducting energy-gap maximum Delta of Bi(2)Sr(2)CaCu(2)O(8+delta). In this material, quasiperiodic variations of unit cell geometry occur in the form of a bulk crystalline "supermodulation." Within each supermodulation period, we find approximately 9 +/- 1% cosinusoidal variation in local Delta that is anticorrelated with the associated d(A) variations. Furthermore, we show that phenomenological consistency would exist between these effects and the random Delta variations found near dopant atoms if the primary effect of the interstitial dopant atom is to displace the apical oxygen so as to diminish d(A) or tilt the CuO(5) pyramid. Thus, we reveal a strong, nonrandom out-of-plane effect on cuprate superconductivity at atomic scale.},

In large molecules and solids, however, calculating the exact (Hartree-Fock) exchange is computationally expensive, especially for systems with metallic characteristics. In the present work, we develop a new hybrid density functional based on a screened Coulomb potential for the exchange interaction which circumvents this bottleneck. The results obtained for structural and thermodynamic properties of molecules are comparable in quality to the most widely used hybrid functionals. In addition, we present results of periodic boundary condition calculations for both semiconducting and metallic single wall carbon nanotubes. Using a screened Coulomb potential for Hartree-Fock exchange enables fast and accurate hybrid calculations, even of usually difficult metallic systems. The high accuracy of the new screened Coulomb potential hybrid, combined with its computational advantages, makes it widely applicable to large molecules and periodic systems.

abstract = {I discuss the impact of gauge-gravity duality on our understanding of two classes of systems: conformal quantum matter and compressible quantum matter. The first conformal class includes systems, such as the boson Hubbard model in two spatial dimensions, which display quantum critical points described by conformal field theories. Questions associated with non-zero temperature dynamics and transport are difficult to answer using conventional field theoretic methods. I argue that many of these can be addressed systematically using gauge-gravity duality, and discuss the prospects for reliable computation of low frequency correlations. Compressible quantum matter is characterized by the smooth dependence of the charge density, associated with a global U(1) symmetry, upon a chemical potential. Familiar examples are solids, superfluids, and Fermi liquids, but there are more exotic possibilities involving deconfined phases of gauge fields in the presence of Fermi surfaces. I survey the compressible systems studied using gauge-gravity duality, and discuss their relationship to the condensed matter classification of such states. The gravity methods offer hope of a deeper understanding of exotic and strongly-coupled compressible quantum states.},

abstract = {We establish a direct connection between scattering amplitudes in planar four-dimensional theories and a remarkable mathematical structure known as the positive Grassmannian. The central physical idea is to focus on on-shell diagrams as objects of fundamental importance to scattering amplitudes. We show that the all-loop integrand in N=4 SYM is naturally represented in this way. On-shell diagrams in this theory are intimately tied to a variety of mathematical objects, ranging from a new graphical representation of permutations to a beautiful stratification of the Grassmannian G(k,n) which generalizes the notion of a simplex in projective space. All physically important operations involving on-shell diagrams map to canonical operations on permutations; in particular, BCFW deformations correspond to adjacent transpositions. Each cell of the positive Grassmannian is naturally endowed with positive coordinates and an invariant measure which determines the on-shell function associated with the diagram. This understanding allows us to classify and compute all on-shell diagrams, and give a geometric understanding for all the non-trivial relations among them. Yangian invariance of scattering amplitudes is transparently represented by diffeomorphisms of G(k,n) which preserve the positive structure. Scattering amplitudes in (1+1)-dimensional integrable systems and the ABJM theory in (2+1) dimensions can both be understood as special cases of these ideas. On-shell diagrams in theories with less (or no) supersymmetry are associated with exactly the same structures in the Grassmannian, but with a measure deformed by a factor encoding ultraviolet singularities. The Grassmannian representation of on-shell processes also gives a new understanding of the all-loop integrand for scattering amplitudes, presenting all integrands in a novel dLog form which directly reflects the underlying positive structure.},

Here we carry out site-specific measurements within each CuO2 unit cell, segregating the results into three separate electronic structure images containing only the Cu sites [Cu(r)] and only the x/y axis O sites [Ox(r) and Oy(r)]. Phase-resolved Fourier analysis reveals directly that the modulations in the Ox(r) and Oy(r) sublattice images consistently exhibit a relative phase of $\pi$. We confirm this discovery on two highly distinct cuprate compounds, ruling out tunnel matrix-element and materials-specific systematics. These observations demonstrate by direct sublattice phase-resolved visualization that the density wave found in underdoped cuprates consists of modulations of the intraunit-cell states that exhibit a predominantly d-symmetry form factor.},

It is a topologically non-trivial state and, as such, exhibits distinctive topological modes at surfaces and defects. In this paper we discuss the current theory and experimental results on chiral superconductors, focusing on two of the best-studied systems, Sr2RuO4, which is thought to be a chiral triplet p-wave superconductor, and UPt3, which has two low-temperature superconducting phases (in zero magnetic field), the lower of which is believed to be chiral triplet f-wave. Other systems that may exhibit chiral superconductivity are also discussed. Key signatures of chiral superconductivity are surface currents and chiral Majorana modes, Majorana states in vortex cores, and the possibility of half-flux quantum vortices in the case of triplet pairing. Experimental evidence for chiral superconductivity from muSR, NMR, strain, polar Kerr effect and Josephson tunneling experiments are discussed.},

The combination of change in unit cell shape, long range of elastic distortion and flow of latent heat leads to large energy barriers resulting in domain structure, hysteresis and cracking. The situation is worse near a triple point, where more than two phases are involved. The well-known metal-insulator transition in vanadium dioxide, a popular candidate for ultrafast optical and electrical switching applications, is a case in point. Even though VO2 is one of the simplest strongly correlated materials, experimental difficulties posed by the first-order nature of the metal-insulator transition as well as the involvement of at least two competing insulating phases have led to persistent controversy about its nature. Here we show that studying single-crystal VO2 nanobeams in a purpose-built nanomechanical strain apparatus allows investigation of this prototypical phase transition with unprecedented control and precision. Our results include the striking finding that the triple point of the metallic phase and two insulating phases is at the transition temperature, Ttr = Tc, which we determine to be 65.0 ± 0.1 °C. The findings have profound implications for the mechanism of the metal-insulator transition in VO2, but they also demonstrate the importance of this approach for mastering phase transitions in many other strongly correlated materials, such as manganites and iron-based superconductors.},

abstract = {Although the existence of nematic order in iron-based superconductors is now a well-established experimental fact, its origin remains controversial. Nematic order breaks the discrete lattice rotational symmetry by making the x and y directions in the iron plane non-equivalent. This can happen because of a regular structural transition or as the result of an electronically driven instability [mdash] in particular, orbital order or spin-driven Ising-nematic order. The latter is a magnetic state that breaks rotational symmetry but preserves time-reversal symmetry. Symmetry dictates that the development of one of these orders immediately induces the other two, making the origin of nematicity a physics realization of the /`chicken and egg problem[rsquor]. In this Review, we argue that the evidence strongly points to an electronic mechanism of nematicity, placing nematic order in the class of correlation-driven electronic instabilities, like superconductivity and density-wave transitions. We discuss different microscopic models for nematicity and link them to the properties of the magnetic and superconducting states, providing a unified perspective on the phase diagram of the iron pnictides.},

@article{Zhu2015,
abstract = {The concept of a charge density wave (CDW) permeates much of condensed matter physics and chemistry. CDWs have their origin rooted in the instability of a one-dimensional system described by Peierls. The extension of this concept to reduced dimensional systems has led to the concept of Fermi surface nesting (FSN), which dictates the wave vector [Formula: see text] of the CDW and the corresponding lattice distortion. The idea is that segments of the Fermi contours are connected by [Formula: see text], resulting in the effective screening of phonons inducing Kohn anomalies in their dispersion at [Formula: see text], driving a lattice restructuring at low temperatures. There is growing theoretical and experimental evidence that this picture fails in many real systems and in fact it is the momentum dependence of the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) matrix element that determines the characteristic of the CDW phase. Based on the published results for the prototypical CDW system 2H-NbSe2, we show how well the [Formula: see text]-dependent EPC matrix element, but not the FSN, can describe the origin of the CDW. We further demonstrate a procedure of combing electronic band and phonon measurements to extract the EPC matrix element, allowing the electronic states involved in the EPC to be identified. Thus, we show that a large EPC does not necessarily induce the CDW phase, with Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+$\delta$ as the example, and the charge-ordered phenomena observed in various cuprates are not driven by FSN or EPC. To experimentally resolve the microscopic picture of EPC will lead to a fundamental change in the way we think about, write about, and classify charge density waves.},

GLAUBER Lymart Laboratory of Physecs, Harvard Umt'versity, Cambridge, Massachttsetts (Received 11 February 1963) The concept of coherence which has conventionally been used in optics is found to be inadequate to the needs of recently opened areas of experiment. To provide a fuller discussion of coherence, a succession of correlation functions for the complex 6eld strengths is de6ned. The nth order function expresses the correla- tion of values of the fields at 2n different points of space and time. Certain values of these functions are measurable by means of n-fold delayed coincidence detection of photons. A fully coherent field is defined as one whose correlation functions satisfy an in6nite succession of stated conditions. Various orders of incomplete coherence are distinguished, according to the number of coherence conditions actually satis6ed. It is noted that the 6elds historically described as coherent in optics have only first-order coherence. On the other hand, the existence, in principle, of 6elds coherent to all orders is shown both in quantum theory and classical theory. The methods used in these discussions apply to fields of arbitrary time dependence. It is shown, as a result, that coherence does not require monochromaticity. Coherent fields can be generated with arbitrary spectra.},

The screened hybrid functional of Heyd, Scuseria and Ernzerhof leads to reasonable solutions for both the low-temperature monoclinic and high-temperature rutile phases only if spin polarization is excluded from the calculations. We explore whether a satisfactory agreement with experiment can be achieved by tuning the fraction of Hartree Fock exchange ($\alpha$) in the density functional. It is found that two branches of locally stable solutions exist for the rutile phase for 12.5%≤$\alpha$≤20%. One is metallic and has the correct stability as compared to the monoclinic phase, the other is insulating with lower energy than the metallic branch. We discuss these observations based on the V 3d orbital occupations and conclude that $\alpha$=10% is the best possible choice for spin-polarized VO2 calculations. {{\textcopyright}} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A general formalism for calculating the instantaneous corre- lation between any two spins is developed and applied to the investigation of short- and long-range order. Both models show nonvanishing long-range order in the ground state for a range of values of a certain parameter $\lambda$which is analogous to an anisotropy parameter in the Heisenberg model. A detailed comparison with the Heisenberg model suggests that the latter has no long-range order in the isotropic case but finite long-range order for any finite amount of anisotropy. The unreliability of variational methods for determin- ing long-range order is emphasized. It is also shown that for spin 1/2 systems having rather general isotropic Heisenberg interactions favoring an antiferromagnetic ordering, the ground state is nondegenerate and there is no energy gap above the ground state in the energy spectrum of the total system.},

Researchers have long been interested in manipulating this transition via the field effect. Here we report attempts to modulate this transition in single-crystal VO2 nanowires via electrochemical gating using ionic liquids. Stray water contamination in the ionic liquid leads to large, slow, hysteretic conductance responses to changes in the gate potential, allowing tuning of the activation energy of the conductance in the insulating state. We suggest that these changes are the result of electrochemical doping via hydrogen. In the absence of this chemical effect, gate response is minimal, suggesting that significant field-effect modulation of the metal−insulator transition is not possible, at least along the crystallographic directions relevant in these nanowires.},

abstract = {First principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations for bulk structural, electronic and optical properties of ternary compounds AgAlX2 (X = S, Se, Te) were performed with two flavours of generalised gradient approximations (PBE and PBEsol) and the hybrid functional HSE06. Using cohesive energy as a stability criterion, we found that the chalcopyrite structure is the favoured phase for these materials. PBEsol gives structural properties closer to the experimental values when compared to the results of PBE. Tetragonal distortion and anion displacement were calculated and we found them to be the cause of the crystal field splitting. Reduction of the bandgap and band splitting around the $\Gamma$ in the Brillouin zone was noted when spin-orbit coupling was included in our study especially in the case of AgAlTe2. The HSE06 bandgap and frequency dependent dielectric function were in very good agreement with experimental results. We have also shown that the maximum absorption peak lies in the ultraviolet range irrespective of the functional used. The refractive index is also discussed.},

A simple nanobeam-substrate adhesion leads to uniaxial strain along the nanobeam length because of the nanobeam's unique morphology. The strain changes the relative stability of the metal (M) and insulator (I) phases and leads to spontaneous formation of periodic, alternating M-I domain patterns during the MIT. The spatial periodicity of the M-I domains can be modified by changing the nanobeam thickness and the Young's modulus of the substrate.},

abstract = {High temperature superconductivity emerges from the antiferromagnetic Mott state when holes are introduced into the CuO2 plane. The electronic structure created by that process1 is not understood, although changes in the electronic state of oxygen atoms appear paramount2-5. Hole doping first destroys the Mott state yielding a weak insulator6,7 where electrons localize only at low temperatures without a full energy gap. At higher doping, the pseudogap state, a weakly conducting state with a large anisotropic energy gap and intra-unit-cell breaking of 90{\textordmasculine}-rotational (C4v) symmetry appears3,4,8-10. However, a direct visualization of the emergence of these phenomena with increasing hole density has never been achieved. Here we report atomic-scale imaging of electronic structure evolution from the weak-insulator through the emergence of the pseudogap to the superconducting state in Ca2-xNaxCuO2Cl2. We find that the spectral signature characteristic of the pseudogap emerges at lowest doping from a weakly insulating but C4v-symmetric matrix that has its own characteristic spectral shape. Then at slightly higher hole-density, nanoscale regions exhibiting pseudogap spectra and 180{\textordmasculine}-rotational (C2v) symmetry form unidirectional clusters within the 2 C4v-symmetric matrix. These findings indicate that doping proceeds by the appearance of nanoscale clusters of localized holes within which the broken-symmetry pseudogap state is stabilized. A fundamentally two-component electronic structure11 then exists until the C2v-symmetric clusters touch each other at higher doping. It is at this stage that the long-range high-Tc superconductivity appears in Ca2-xNaxCuO2Cl2},

It is then observed that the particles, going in and out, form quantum states bouncing against the horizon. The dynamics of these microstates can be described in a partial wave expansion, but Hawking's expression for the entropy then requires a cut-off in the transverse momentum, in the form of a Brillouin zone, and this implies that these particles live on a lattice.},

Approximations appropriate to low temperatures and equivalent to those used by Bloch in his derivation of the T1 law, are introduced. The resultant expression for the intrinsic volume susceptibility decreases slowly with increasing field; at high fields the functional dependence is as the inverse square root of the field. The variation with temperature is linear; at room temperature and for fields of about 4000 gauss, the order of magnitude of the (volume) susceptibility is 10-4. The results are compared with experiment and satisfactory agreement is found.},

Our study yields new insight into the low-energy spectra of cuprates and opens up a pathway toward wide-ranging first-principles investigations of electronic structures of cuprates and other correlated materials.},

abstract = {The role of electron-electron interactions in determining the electron-phonon interaction in metals is investigated by extending the Bohm-Pines collective description to take into account the ionic motion. Collective coordinates are introduced to describe the long-range electron-ionic correlations, and it is shown by a series of canonical transformations that these give rise to plasma waves and to coupled electron-ion waves which correspond to longitudinal sound waves. The dispersion relation for the sound waves is identical with that derived by Toya and Nakajima by self-consistent field methods. The velocity of these sound waves is calculated from first principles for sodium and is found to be in good agreement with experiment. The effective matrix element for the electron-phonon interaction is determined and is found to be identical for long wavelengths with that found earlier by Bardeen using a self-consistent field method which neglects exchange and correlation effects. The agreement with the earlier work is explained by the fact that the residual electron-electron interaction is of quite short range, so that an independent-particle treatment is rather well justified. The effects of Coulomb correlations on superconductivity are likewise shown to be small, so that the neglect of Coulomb interactions in the formulation of the superconductivity problem is justified.},

abstract = {The development of high efficiency perovskite solar cells has sparked a multitude of measurements on the optical properties of these materials. For the most studied methylammonium(MA)PbI 3 perovskite, a large range (6-55 meV) of exciton binding energies has been reported by various experiments. The existence of excitons at room temperature is unclear. For the MAPbX 3 perovskites we report on relativistic Bethe-Salpeter Equation calculations (GW-BSE). This method is capable to directly calculate excitonic properties from first-principles. At low temperatures it predicts exciton binding energies in agreement with the reported {\^{a}} € large' values. For MAPbI 3, phonon modes present in this frequency range have a negligible contribution to the ionic screening. By calculating the polarization in time from finite temperature molecular dynamics, we show that at room temperature this does not change. We therefore exclude ionic screening as an explanation for the experimentally observed reduction of the exciton binding energy at room temperature and argue in favor of the formation of polarons.},

abstract = {Unconventional superconductivity typically occurs in materials in which a small change of a parameter such as bandwidth or doping leads to antiferromagnetic or Mott insulating phases. As such competing phases are approached, the properties of the superconductor often become increasingly exotic. For example, in organic superconductors and underdoped high-T(c) cuprate superconductors a fluctuating superconducting state persists to temperatures significantly above T(c). By studying alloys of quasi-two-dimensional organic molecular metals in the $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)₂X family, we reveal how the Nernst effect, a sensitive probe of superconducting phase fluctuations, evolves in the regime of extreme Mott criticality. We find strong evidence that, as the phase diagram is traversed through superconductivity towards the Mott state, the temperature scale for superconducting fluctuations increases dramatically, eventually approaching the temperature at which quasiparticles become identifiable at all.},

@article{Park2013,
abstract = {First-order phase transitions in solids are notoriously challenging to study. The combination of change in unit cell shape, long range of elastic distortion and flow of latent heat leads to large energy barriers resulting in domain structure, hysteresis and cracking. The situation is worse near a triple point, where more than two phases are involved. The well-known metal-insulator transition in vanadium dioxide, a popular candidate for ultrafast optical and electrical switching applications, is a case in point. Even though VO2 is one of the simplest strongly correlated materials, experimental difficulties posed by the first-order nature of the metal-insulator transition as well as the involvement of at least two competing insulating phases have led to persistent controversy about its nature. Here we show that studying single-crystal VO2 nanobeams in a purpose-built nanomechanical strain apparatus allows investigation of this prototypical phase transition with unprecedented control and precision. Our results include the striking finding that the triple point of the metallic phase and two insulating phases is at the transition temperature, Ttr = Tc, which we determine to be 65.0 ± 0.1 °C. The findings have profound implications for the mechanism of the metal-insulator transition in VO2, but they also demonstrate the importance of this approach for mastering phase transitions in many other strongly correlated materials, such as manganites and iron-based superconductors.},

abstract = {The influence of finite size in altering the phase stabilities of strongly correlated materials gives rise to the interesting prospect of achieving additional tunability of solid–solid phase transitions such as those involved in metal–insulator switching, ferroelectricity, and superconductivity. We note here some distinctive finite size effects on the relative phase stabilities of insulating (monoclinic) and metallic (tetragonal) phases of solid-solution WxV1xO2. Ensemble differential scanning calorimetry and individual nanobelt electrical transport measurements suggest a pronounced hysteresis between metal /insulator and insulator/metal phase transformations. Both transitions are depressed to lower critical temperatures upon the incorporation of substitutional tungsten dopants but the impact on the former transition seems far more prominent. In general, the depression in the critical temperatures upon tungsten doping far exceeds corresponding values for bulkWxV1xO2 of the same composition. Notably, the depression in phase transition temperature saturates at a relatively low dopant concentration in the nanobelts, thought to be associated with the specific sites occupied by the tungsten substitutional dopants in these structures. The marked deviations from bulk behavior are rationalized in terms of a percolative model of the phase transition taking into account the nucleation of locally tetragonal domains and enhanced carrier delocalization that accompanyW6+ doping in the WxV1xO2 nanobelts},

It is well known that such a metal has a superconducting instability induced by the formation of spin-singlet pairs of electrons, with the pairing amplitude changing sign between regions of the Fermi surface connected by the spin density wave ordering wavevector. Here we review recent arguments that there is an additional instability which is nearly as strong: towards the onset of a modulated bond order which is locally an Ising-nematic order. This new instability is a consequence of an emergent "pseudospin" symmetry of the low energy theory---the symmetry maps the sign-changing pairing amplitude to the bond order parameter.},

abstract = {The renormalization-group method of Gell-Mann and Low is applied to field theories of strong inter-actions. It is assumed that renormalization-group equations exist for strong interactions which involve one or several momentum-dependent coupling constants. The further assumption that these coupling constants approach 6xed values as the momentum goes to inhnity is discussed in detail. However, an alternative is suggested, namely, that these coupling constants approach a limit cycle in the limit of large momenta. Some results of this paper are: (1) The e+-e annihilation experiments above 1-GeV energy may distinguish a fixed point from a limit cycle or other asymptotic behavior. (2) If electrodynamics or weak interactions become strong above some large momentum A. , then the renormalization group can be used (in principle) to determine the renormalized coupling constants of strong interactions, except for U(3) && U(3) symmetry-breaking parameters. (3) Mass terms in the Lagrangian of strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions must break a symmetry of the combined interactions with zero mass. (4) The AI =-, rule in nonleptonic weak interactions can be understood assuming only that a renormalization group exists for strong interactions.},

abstract = {The Luttinger-Ward functional $\Phi[\mathbf{G}]$, which expresses the thermodynamic grand potential in terms of the interacting single-particle Green's function $\mathbf{G}$, is found to be ill-defined for fermionic models with the Hubbard on-site interaction. In particular, we show that the self-energy $\mathbf{\Sigma}[\mathbf{G}] \propto \delta\Phi[\mathbf{G}]/\delta\mathbf{G}$ is \textit{not} a single-valued functional of $\mathbf{G}$: in addition to the physical solution for $\mathbf{\Sigma}[\mathbf{G}]$, there exists at least one qualitatively distinct unphysical branch. This result is demonstrated for several models: the Hubbard atom, the Anderson impurity model, and the full two-dimensional Hubbard model. Despite this pathology, the skeleton Feynman diagrammatic series for $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ in terms of $\mathbf{G}$ is found to converge at least for moderately low temperatures. However, at strong interactions, its convergence is to the unphysical branch. This reveals a new scenario of breaking down of diagrammatic expansions. In contrast, the bare series in terms of the non-interacting Green's function $\mathbf{G}_0$ converges to the correct physical branch of $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ in all cases currently accessible by diagrammatic Monte Carlo. Besides their conceptual importance, these observations have important implications for techniques based on the explicit summation of diagrammatic series.},

abstract = {The well-known “band-gap” problem in approximate density functionals is manifested mainly in an overly low energy of the conduction band (CB). As a consequence, the localized gap states of 3d impurities states in wide-gap oxides such as ZnO occur often incorrectly as resonances inside the CB, leading to a spurious transfer of electrons from the impurity state into the CB of the host, and to a physically misleading description of the magnetic 3d-3d interactions. A correct description requires that the magnetic coupling of the impurity pairs be self-consistently determined in the presence of a correctly positioned CB (with respect to the 3d states), which we achieve here through the addition of empirical nonlocal external potentials to the standard density functional Hamiltonian. After this correction, both Co and Cr form occupied localized states in the gap and empty resonances low inside the CB. In otherwise undoped ZnO, Co and Cr remain paramagnetic, but electron-doping instigates strong ferromagnetic coupling when the resonant states become partially occupied.},

After constructing a maximally general model of discrete spacetime suitable for our purpose—a chain complex equipped with an inner product on ( p + 1)-cochains—we study both the classical and quantum versions of the theory, with either ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0264-9381/23/17/004/cqg219461ieqn1.gif] {{\bb R}} or U (1) as gauge group. We find results—such as a ' p -form Bohm–Aharonov effect'—that depend in interesting ways on the cohomology of spacetime. We quantize the theory via the Euclidean path integral formalism, where the natural kernels in the U (1) theory are not Gaussians but theta functions. As a special case of the general theory, we show that p -form electromagnetism in p + 1 dimensions has an exact solution which reduces when p = 1 to the Abelian case of 2D Yang–Mills theory as studied by Migdal and Witten. Our main result describes p -form electromagnetism as a 'chain field theory'—a theory analogous to a topological quantum field theory, but with chain complexes replacing manifolds. This makes precise a notion of time evolution in the context of discrete spacetimes of arbitrary topology.},

@article{Stoneham2003,
abstract = {Computing comprises three distinct strands: hardware, software and the ways they are used in real or imagined worlds. Its use in research is more than writing or running code. Having something significant to compute and deploying judgement in what is attempted and achieved are especially challenging. In science or engineering, one must define a central problem in computable form, run such software as is appropriate and, last but by no means least, convince others that the results are both valid and useful. These several strands are highly interdependent. A major scientific development can transform disparate aspects of information and computer technologies. Computers affect the way we do science, as well as changing our personal worlds. Access to information is being transformed, with consequences beyond research or even science. Creativity in research is usually considered uniquely human, with inspiration a central factor. Scientific and technological needs are major forces in innovation, and these include hardware and software opportunities. One can try to define the scientific needs for established technologies (atomic energy, the early semiconductor industry), for rapidly developing technologies (advanced materials, microelectronics) and for emerging technologies (nanotechnology, novel information technologies). Did these needs define new computing, or was science diverted into applications of then-available codes? Regarding credibility, why is it that engineers accept computer realizations when designing engineered structures, whereas predictive modelling of materials has yet to achieve industrial confidence outside very special cases? The tensions between computing and traditional science are complex, unpredictable and potentially powerful.},

abstract = {High temperature superconductivity emerges from the antiferromagnetic Mott state when holes are introduced into the CuO2 plane. The electronic structure created by that process1 is not understood, although changes in the electronic state of oxygen atoms appear paramount2-5. Hole doping first destroys the Mott state yielding a weak insulator6,7 where electrons localize only at low temperatures without a full energy gap. At higher doping, the pseudogap state, a weakly conducting state with a large anisotropic energy gap and intra-unit-cell breaking of 90{\textordmasculine}-rotational (C4v) symmetry appears3,4,8-10. However, a direct visualization of the emergence of these phenomena with increasing hole density has never been achieved. Here we report atomic-scale imaging of electronic structure evolution from the weak-insulator through the emergence of the pseudogap to the superconducting state in Ca2-xNaxCuO2Cl2. We find that the spectral signature characteristic of the pseudogap emerges at lowest doping from a weakly insulating but C4v-symmetric matrix that has its own characteristic spectral shape. Then at slightly higher hole-density, nanoscale regions exhibiting pseudogap spectra and 180{\textordmasculine}-rotational (C2v) symmetry form unidirectional clusters within the 2 C4v-symmetric matrix. These findings indicate that doping proceeds by the appearance of nanoscale clusters of localized holes within which the broken-symmetry pseudogap state is stabilized. A fundamentally two-component electronic structure11 then exists until the C2v-symmetric clusters touch each other at higher doping. It is at this stage that the long-range high-Tc superconductivity appears in Ca2-xNaxCuO2Cl2},

abstract = {The well-known “band-gap” problem in approximate density functionals is manifested mainly in an overly low energy of the conduction band (CB). As a consequence, the localized gap states of 3d impurities states in wide-gap oxides such as ZnO occur often incorrectly as resonances inside the CB, leading to a spurious transfer of electrons from the impurity state into the CB of the host, and to a physically misleading description of the magnetic 3d-3d interactions. A correct description requires that the magnetic coupling of the impurity pairs be self-consistently determined in the presence of a correctly positioned CB (with respect to the 3d states), which we achieve here through the addition of empirical nonlocal external potentials to the standard density functional Hamiltonian. After this correction, both Co and Cr form occupied localized states in the gap and empty resonances low inside the CB. In otherwise undoped ZnO, Co and Cr remain paramagnetic, but electron-doping instigates strong ferromagnetic coupling when the resonant states become partially occupied.},

Experimentally, phonon modes along the {\Gamma} - M line, i.e. q = (h, 0, 0) with 0 <= h <= 0.5, with the same longitudinal symmetry ({\Sigma}1) as the CDW soft mode were investigated up to 32 meV. In agreement with our calculations we observe significant EPC in the optic modes at h <= 0.2. We analyze the EPC in the optic as well as acoustic modes and show that the q dependences stem from scattering processes between two bands at the Fermi surface both having Nb 4d character. Finally, we demonstrate that the soft mode dispersion at T = 33 K (= {T_{CDW}}) can be well described on the basis of a strongly q dependent EPC matrix element and an acoustic-like bare phonon dispersion in agreement with observations near room temperature.},

abstract = {The pairing theory of superconductivity is extended to treat systems having strong electron-phonon coupling. In this regime the Landau quasiparticle approximation is invalid. In the theory we treat phonon and Coulomb interactions on the same basis and carry out the analysis using the nonzero-temperature Green's functions of the Nambu formalism. The generalized energy-gap equation thus obtained is solved (at T=0 °K) for a model which closely represents lead and the complex energy-gap parameter $\Delta$($\omega$)) is plotted as a function of energy for several choices of phonon and Coulomb interaction strengths. An expression for the single-particle tunneling density of states is derived, which, when combined with $\Delta$($\omega$), gives excellent agreement with experiment, if the phonon interaction strength is chosen to give the observed energy gap $\Delta$0 at zero temperature. The tunneling experiments therefore give a detailed justification of the phonon mechanism of superconductivity and of the validity of the strong-coupling theory. In addition, by combining theory and the tunneling experiments, much can be learned about the electron-phon interaction and the phonon density of states. The theory is accurate to terms of order the square root of the electron-ion mass ratio, ∼10-2-10-3.},

abstract = {This theory develops a quantum analog of the classical electron oscillator model. It argues first that the Hamiltonian of long-wave excitations of matter is equivalent to that of an assembly of oscillators under very general assumptions. Next, these oscillators are coupled with the electromagnetic field oscillators and the normal modes of the coupled system are analyzed. The normal modes of longitudinal and transverse excita- tion have different spectra; the transverse frequencies depend strongly on the wavelength but the longi- tudinal ones do not. If the "longitudinal photons" are eliminated after the transformation to normal modes, the resulting Coulomb law has the dielectric constant in the denominator. The dielectric response law is expressed as a series of oscillations and also in terms of Van Hove s correlation function. Horn-approxi- mation theory of the collisions of fast charged particles with the assembly of normal mode {longitudinal and transverse) oscillators yields the same total cross section as Fermi's macroscopic theory. The transverse excitations include the Cerenkov radiation.}},

@article{Shin1990,
abstract = {Vacuum-ultraviolet reflectance and photoemission spectra of VO2, V2O3, V6O13, and V2O5 are measured in order to investigate the 3d-band structures and electron-correlation effects. In the case of VO2, drastic changes in the 3d (pi* and d||) band structures are found in both spectra through the metal-insulator phase transition. The pi* and d|| bands are found at the Fermi level and Eb=1.3 eV in the photoemission spectra of metallic VO2. In the insulating phase, the pi* valence band in the photoemission spectra becomes empty and a rise of the pi* conduction band by about 0.5 eV is found in the reflectance spectra. This band shift through the phase transition may be a driving force of the metal-insulator transition of VO2. The optical band gap between the d|| valence and pi* conduction bands is obtained as 0.7 eV in the insulating phase, to which the pi*-d|| correlation energy contributes partially. The splitting of the d|| band is also found in the insulating phase. This splitting energy is about 2.5 eV, while the bandwidth of the d|| band is about 1.5 eV. This large band splitting is mainly due to the correlation energy of d|| electrons of about U(d||, d||)=2.1 eV. On the other hand, no drastic change is found in the 3d-band structures of V6O13 and V2O3 except for slight changes in the bandwidths. Furthermore, the density of states at the Fermi level is rather low in these materials even in the metallic phase. These facts support the view that the electron-correlation effects are important and Mott-type metal-insulator transitions are induced in V6O13 and V2O3. Resonant photoemission from V3d and O2p bands are observed as the photon energy is swept through the 3p->3d optical-absorption transition. The resonance profiles of V3d bands show the characteristic antiresonance dip, while those of O2p bands show rather broad and simple enhancements. The multiplet structures in the 3p core photoemission spectra of VO2 and V203 are quantitatively analyzed with use of results from the calculations of Yamaguchi et al.},

abstract = {The elastic properties and structural phase transitions of individual VO(2) nanowires were studied using an in situ push-to-pull microelectromechanical device to realize quantitative tensile analysis in a transmission electron microscope and a synchrotron X-ray microdiffraction beamline. A plateau was detected in the stress-strain curve, signifying superelasticity of the nanowire arising from the M1-M2 structural phase transition. The transition was induced and controlled by uniaxial tension. The transition dynamics were characterized by a one-dimensionally aligned domain structure with pinning and depinning of the domain walls along the nanowire. From the stress-strain dependence the Young's moduli of the VO(2) M1 and M2 phases were estimated to be 128 ± 10 and 156 ± 10 GPa, respectively. Single pinning and depinning events of M1-M2 domain wall were observed in the superelastic regime, allowing for evaluation of the domain wall pinning potential energy. This study demonstrates a new way to investigate nanoscale mechanics and dynamics of structural phase transitions in general.},

abstract = {We introduce a formalism for describing four-dimensional scattering amplitudes for particles of any mass and spin. This naturally extends the familiar spinor-helicity formalism for massless particles to one where these variables carry an extra SU(2) little group index for massive particles, with the amplitudes for spin S particles transforming as symmetric rank 2S tensors. We systematically characterise all possible three particle amplitudes compatible with Poincare symmetry. Unitarity, in the form of consistent factorization, imposes algebraic conditions that can be used to construct all possible four-particle tree amplitudes. This also gives us a convenient basis in which to expand all possible four-particle amplitudes in terms of what can be called "spinning polynomials". Many general results of quantum field theory follow the analysis of four-particle scattering, ranging from the set of all possible consistent theories for massless particles, to spin-statistics, and the Weinberg-Witten theorem. We also find a transparent understanding for why massive particles of sufficiently high spin can not be "elementary". The Higgs and Super-Higgs mechanisms are naturally discovered as an infrared unification of many disparate helicity amplitudes into a smaller number of massive amplitudes, with a simple understanding for why this can't be extended to Higgsing for gravitons. We illustrate a number of applications of the formalism at one-loop, giving few-line computations of the electron (g-2) as well as the beta function and rational terms in QCD. "Off-shell" observables like correlation functions and form-factors can be thought of as scattering amplitudes with external "probe" particles of general mass and spin, so all these objects--amplitudes, form factors and correlators, can be studied from a common on-shell perspective.},

abstract = {Close to optimal doping, the copper oxide superconductors show 'strange metal' behaviour, suggestive of strong fluctuations associated with a quantum critical point. Such a critical point requires a line of classical phase transitions terminating at zero temperature near optimal doping inside the superconducting 'dome'. The underdoped region of the temperature-doping phase diagram from which superconductivity emerges is referred to as the 'pseudogap' because evidence exists for partial gapping of the conduction electrons, but so far there is no compelling thermodynamic evidence as to whether the pseudogap is a distinct phase or a continuous evolution of physical properties on cooling. Here we report that the pseudogap in YBa2Cu3O6+$\delta$ is a distinct phase, bounded by a line of phase transitions. The doping dependence of this line is such that it terminates at zero temperature inside the superconducting dome. From this we conclude that quantum criticality drives the strange metallic behaviour and therefore superconductivity in the copper oxide superconductors.},

abstract = {I discuss the impact of gauge-gravity duality on our understanding of two classes of systems: conformal quantum matter and compressible quantum matter. The first conformal class includes systems, such as the boson Hubbard model in two spatial dimensions, which display quantum critical points described by conformal field theories. Questions associated with non-zero temperature dynamics and transport are difficult to answer using conventional field theoretic methods. I argue that many of these can be addressed systematically using gauge-gravity duality, and discuss the prospects for reliable computation of low frequency correlations. Compressible quantum matter is characterized by the smooth dependence of the charge density, associated with a global U(1) symmetry, upon a chemical potential. Familiar examples are solids, superfluids, and Fermi liquids, but there are more exotic possibilities involving deconfined phases of gauge fields in the presence of Fermi surfaces. I survey the compressible systems studied using gauge-gravity duality, and discuss their relationship to the condensed matter classification of such states. The gravity methods offer hope of a deeper understanding of exotic and strongly-coupled compressible quantum states.},

abstract = {We analyze theoretically physical mechanisms responsible for the radiative recombination of the ground optically passive (“dark”) exciton (DE), which dominates in photoluminescence (PL) of colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) at low temperatures. The DE becomes optically active due to its mixing with the bright excitons caused by an external magnetic field, dangling-bond spins or by acoustic and optical phonons. These activation mechanisms mix the DE with different bright excitons and, consequently, lead to different PL polarization properties, because they are determined by dipole orientations of the bright excitons, which the DE is coupled with. We show that the PL polarization properties of prolate and oblate shape NCs are different due to different activation mechanisms responsible for the DE recombination.},

abstract = {Neutron and X-ray scattering experiments have provided mounting evidence for spin and charge ordering phenomena in underdoped cuprates. These range from early work on stripe correlations in Nd-LSCO to the latest discovery of charge-density-waves in YBa2Cu3O(6+x). Both phenomena are characterized by a pronounced dependence on doping, temperature and an externally applied magnetic field. Here, we show that these electron-lattice instabilities exhibit also a previously unrecognized bulk-surface dichotomy. Surface-sensitive electronic and structural probes uncover a temperature-dependent evolution of the CuO2 plane band dispersion and apparent Fermi pockets in underdoped Bi2 Sr(2-x) La(x) CuO(6+$\delta$) (Bi2201), which is directly associated with an hitherto-undetected strong temperature dependence of the incommensurate superstructure periodicity below 130 K. In stark contrast, the structural modulation revealed by bulk-sensitive probes is temperature-independent. These findings point to a surface-enhanced incipient charge-density-wave instability, driven by Fermi surface nesting. This discovery is of critical importance in the interpretation of single-particle spectroscopy data, and establishes the surface of cuprates and other complex oxides as a rich playground for the study of electronically soft phases.},

abstract = {The rapid transcendence of organic-inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells to above the 20% efficiency mark has captivated the broad photovoltaic community. As the efficiency race continues unabated, it is essential that fundamental studies keep pace with these developments. Further gains in device efficiencies are expected to be increasingly arduous and harder to come by. The key to driving the perovskite solar cell efficiencies towards their Shockley-Queisser limit is through a clear understanding of the interfacial energetics and dynamics between perovskites and other functional materials in nanostructured- and heterojunction-type devices. In this review, we focus on the current progress in basic characterization studies to elucidate the interfacial energetics (energy-level alignment and band bending) and dynamical processes (from the ultrafast to the ultraslow) in organic-inorganic metal halide perovskite photovoltaics and light emitters. Major findings from these studies will be distilled. Open questions and scientific challenges will also be highlighted.},

The band gaps and energy spectra show an excellent agreement with the experimentally observed results and are discussed in details. The calculated width of d-bands of V2O3 is much narrower than that of the observed one which may be a mixture of t2g 2 multiplet and single electron t2g level. GWA or U+GWA does not work also in the paramagnetic phase of V2O3 and the reason for thois is clarified. The method of the unique choice of on-site Coulomb interaction is discussed in details.

The screened hybrid functional of Heyd, Scuseria and Ernzerhof leads to reasonable solutions for both the low-temperature monoclinic and high-temperature rutile phases only if spin polarization is excluded from the calculations. We explore whether a satisfactory agreement with experiment can be achieved by tuning the fraction of Hartree Fock exchange ($\alpha$) in the density functional. It is found that two branches of locally stable solutions exist for the rutile phase for 12.5%≤$\alpha$≤20%. One is metallic and has the correct stability as compared to the monoclinic phase, the other is insulating with lower energy than the metallic branch. We discuss these observations based on the V 3d orbital occupations and conclude that $\alpha$=10% is the best possible choice for spin-polarized VO2 calculations. {{{\textcopyright}}} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A versatile method for combining density functional theory (DFT) in the local density approximation (LDA) with dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) is presented. Starting from a general basis-independent formulation, we use Wannier functions as an interface between the two theories. These functions are used for the physical purpose of identifying the correlated orbitals in a specific material, and also for the more technical purpose of interfacing DMFT with different kinds of band-structure methods (with three different techniques being used in the present work). We explore and compare two distinct Wannier schemes, namely the maximally-localized-Wannier-function (MLWF) and the $N$-th order muffin-tin-orbital (NMTO) methods. Two correlated materials with different degrees of structural and electronic complexity, SrVO3 and BaVS3, are investigated as case studies. SrVO3 belongs to the canonical class of correlated transition-metal oxides, and is chosen here as a test case in view of its simple structure and physical properties. In contrast, the sulfide BaVS3 is known for its rich and complex physics, associated with strong correlation effects and low-dimensional characteristics. New insights into the physics associated with the metal-insulator transition of this compound are provided, particularly regarding correlation-induced modifications of its Fermi surface. Additionally, the necessary formalism for implementing self-consistency over the electronic charge density in a Wannier basis is discussed.},

abstract = {Unconventional superconductivity typically occurs in materials in which a small change of a parameter such as bandwidth or doping leads to antiferromagnetic or Mott insulating phases. As such competing phases are approached, the properties of the superconductor often become increasingly exotic. For example, in organic superconductors and underdoped high-T(c) cuprate superconductors a fluctuating superconducting state persists to temperatures significantly above T(c). By studying alloys of quasi-two-dimensional organic molecular metals in the $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)₂X family, we reveal how the Nernst effect, a sensitive probe of superconducting phase fluctuations, evolves in the regime of extreme Mott criticality. We find strong evidence that, as the phase diagram is traversed through superconductivity towards the Mott state, the temperature scale for superconducting fluctuations increases dramatically, eventually approaching the temperature at which quasiparticles become identifiable at all.},

abstract = {The program phon calculates force constant matrices and phonon frequencies in crystals. From the frequencies it also calculates various thermodynamic quantities, like the Helmholtz free energy, the entropy, the specific heat and the internal energy of the harmonic crystal. The procedure is based on the small displacement method, and can be used in combination with any program capable to calculate forces on the atoms of the crystal. In order to examine the usability of the method, I present here two examples: metallic Al and insulating MgO. The phonons of these two materials are calculated using density functional theory. The small displacement method results are compared with those obtained using the linear response method. In the case of Al the method provides accurate phonon frequencies everywhere in the Brillouin Zone (BZ). In the case of MgO the longitudinal branch of the optical phonons near the centre of the BZ is incorrectly described as degenerate with the two transverse branches, because the non-analytical part of the dynamical matrix is ignored here; however, thermodynamic properties like the Helmholtz free are essentially unaffected.

External routines: Subprograms ZHEEV and DSYEV (Lapack); needs BLAS. A tutorial is provided with the distribution which requires the installation of the quantum-espresso package (http://www.quantum-espresso.org). Nature of problem: Stable crystals at low temperature can be well described by expanding the potential energy around the atomic equilibrium positions. The movements of the atoms around their equilibrium positions can then be described using harmonic theory, and is characterised by global vibrations called phonons, which can be identified by vectors in the Brillouin zone of the crystal, and there are 3 phonon branches for each atom in the primitive cell. The problem is to calculate the frequencies of these phonons for any arbitrary choice of q-vector in the Brillouin zone. Solution method: The small displacement method: each atom in the primitive cell is displaced by a small amount, and the forces induced on all the other atoms in the crystal are calculated and used to construct the force constant matrix. Supercells of ∼100 atoms are usually large enough to describe the force constant matrix up to the range where its elements have fallen to negligibly small values. The force constant matrix is then used to compute the dynamical matrix at any chosen q-vector in the Brillouin zone, and the diagonalisation of the dynamical matrix provides the squares of the phonon frequencies. The PHON code needs external programs to calculate these forces, and it can be used with any program capable of calculating forces in crystals. The most useful applications are obtained with codes based on density functional theory, but there is no restriction on what can be used. Running time: Negligible, typically a few seconds (or at most a few minutes) on a PC. It can take longer if very dense meshes of q-points are needed, for example, to compute very accurate phonon density of states. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Hartree-Fock equations state that each electron in an atom or molecular system should move in a different potential. In some cases, particularly magnetic cases, this leads to important consequences, since electrons with opposite spins move in different potentials. In particular, in an antiferromagnetic substance, electrons of + and - spin have different potentials; and for an electron of + spin, for instance, the potential energy is lower in those atoms whose spins are pointed in the + direction than in those with the opposite spin. This results in a periodic perturbation of potential, with periodicity twice the atomic periodicity, and leads to a splitting of each energy band in half, with a gap in the middle. In a case where the energy band was half full, resulting in a conductor: when we disregard this effect, the resulting half-band will be just filled when we consider it; this may explain the insulating nature of some antiferromagnetics. A similar argument applied to a diatomic molecule like H2 can result in two alternative types of solutions of the Hartree-Fock equations: one leading to atomic orbitals, the other to molecular orbitals. The solution with atomic orbitals shows an analogy to the antiferromagnetic problem; that with ordinary molecular orbitals shows an analogy to the band theory of a non-magnetic conductor.},

abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) is the most widely used technique in the realm of first-principles electronic structure methods. Principally, this is because DFT in the Kohn–Sham (KS) formalism offers the appealing combination of relatively high accuracy and relatively low computational cost. Despite their great successes, traditional semilocal functionals fail to describe some important problems in solid state physics and materials science, the most conspicuous example being the notorious band gap problem. More sophisticated functionals providing greater accuracy without sacrificing computational efficiency are therefore needed. The Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) screened hybrid density functional [J. Heyd, G. E. Scuseria, and M. Ernzerhof, J. Chem. Phys. 118, 8207 (2003); J. Heyd and G. E. Scuseria, J. Chem. Phys. 121, 1187 (2004)] successfully addresses some of the chief problems which plague semilocal functionals by including only the important parts of exact nonlocal Hartree–Fock-type exchange. This work discusses some of the concepts underlying HSE and provides illustrative examples highlighting the successes of HSE in numerous solid state applications},

abstract = {Multiple-cation mixed-halide (Cs,FA,MA)Pb(I,Br)3 perovskites containing cesium, formamidinium (FA), and methylammonium (MA) possess excellent properties for a wide range of optoelectronic applications such as thin-film photovoltaics or lasers. We investigate the role of excitons and the exciton binding energy EB, relevant for the effectiveness of charge separation in solar cells, as well as the temperature-dependent bandgap energy Eg which is used as an indicator for crystal phase transitions. Generalized Elliott fits of absorption spectra offer the possibility to determine both EB and Eg. However, since excitonic effects are non-negligible even at room temperature, a careful and detailed analysis of the spectra is crucial for a correct interpretation. Therefore, an additional evaluation based on a so-called f-sum rule is applied to achieve an improved reliability of the results at higher temperatures. The obtained EB values of 20-24 meV for Cs-containing mixed perovskite compounds are below the ones of 24-32 meV and 36-41 meV for pure methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) and bromide (MAPbBr3), respectively, and, thus, facilitate charge-carrier separation in photovoltaic applications. Furthermore, temperature-dependent (T = 5-300 K) studies of Eg in (Cs,FA,MA)Pb(I,Br)3 indicate a suppressed crystal phase transition by the absence of any phase-transition related signatures such as the well-known jump of about 100 meV in MAPbI3. We verify these results using temperature-dependent electroreflectance spectroscopy, which is a very reliable technique for the direct and non-destructive determination of optical resonances of the absorber layer in complete solar cells. Additionally, we confirm the suppression of the phase transition in Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 by temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction.},

abstract = {We review the dynamical mean-field theory of strongly correlated electron systems which is based on a mapping of lattice models onto quantum impurity models subject to a self-consistency condition. This mapping is exact for models of correlated electrons in the limit of large lattice coordination (or infinite spatial dimensions). It extends the standard mean-field construction from classical statistical mechanics to quantum problems. We discuss the physical ideas underlying this theory and its mathematical derivation. Various analytic and numerical techniques that have been developed recently in order to analyze and solve the dynamical mean-field equations are reviewed and compared to each other. The method can be used for the determination of phase diagrams (by comparing the stability of various types of long-range order), and the calculation of thermodynamic properties, one-particle Green's functions, and response functions. We review in detail the recent progress in understanding the Hubbard model and the Mott metal-insulator transition within this approach, including some comparison to experiments on three-dimensional transition-metal oxides. We present an overview of the rapidly developing field of applications of this method to other systems. The present limitations of the approach, and possible extensions of the formalism are finally discussed. Computer programs for the numerical implementation of this method are also provided with this article.},

With the derived effective electron-phonon interactions and phonon frequencies, we estimate the static part ($\omega$=0) of the phonon-mediated effective on-site intra- or inter-orbital electron-electron attractions as $\sim$ -0.4 eV and exchange or pair-hopping terms as $\sim$ -0.02 eV. We analyze the model with the derived interactions together with the electronic repulsions within the random phase approximation. We find that the enhancement of the orbital fluctuations due to the electron-phonon interactions is small, making the spin fluctuations dominant. As a result, the superconducting state with the sign reversal in gap functions ($s_\pm$-wave) is realized.},

abstract = {Following the discovery of long-range antiferromagnetic order in the parent compounds of high-transition-temperature (high-T(c)) copper oxides, there have been efforts to understand the role of magnetism in the superconductivity that occurs when mobile 'electrons' or 'holes' are doped into the antiferromagnetic parent compounds. Superconductivity in the newly discovered rare-earth iron-based oxide systems ROFeAs (R, rare-earth metal) also arises from either electron or hole doping of their non-superconducting parent compounds. The parent material LaOFeAs is metallic but shows anomalies near 150 K in both resistivity and d.c. magnetic susceptibility. Although optical conductivity and theoretical calculations suggest that LaOFeAs exhibits a spin-density-wave (SDW) instability that is suppressed by doping with electrons to induce superconductivity, there has been no direct evidence of SDW order. Here we report neutron-scattering experiments that demonstrate that LaOFeAs undergoes an abrupt structural distortion below 155 K, changing the symmetry from tetragonal (space group P4/nmm) to monoclinic (space group P112/n) at low temperatures, and then, at approximately 137 K, develops long-range SDW-type antiferromagnetic order with a small moment but simple magnetic structure. Doping the system with fluorine suppresses both the magnetic order and the structural distortion in favour of superconductivity. Therefore, like high-T(c) copper oxides, the superconducting regime in these iron-based materials occurs in close proximity to a long-range-ordered antiferromagnetic ground state.},

The lack of direct evidence for electron-phonon coupling in the electron dynamics of the high-transition-temperature superconductors has driven an intensive search for an alternative mechanism. A coupling of an electron with a phonon would result in an abrupt change of its velocity and scattering rate near the phonon energy. Here we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to probe electron dynamics-velocity and scattering rate-for three different families of copper oxide superconductors. We see in all of these materials an abrupt change of electron velocity at 50-80 meV, which we cannot explain by any known process other than to invoke coupling with the phonons associated with the movement of the oxygen atoms. This suggests that electron-phonon coupling strongly influences the electron dynamics in the high-temperature superconductors, and must therefore be included in any microscopic theory of superconductivity.},

@article{Katz2014,
abstract = {We argue that extensions of the Standard Model (SM) with a strongly first-order electroweak phase transition generically predict significant deviations of the Higgs couplings to gluons, photons, and Z bosons from their SM values. Precise experimental measurements of the Higgs couplings at the LHC and at the proposed next-generation facilities will allow for a robust test of the phase transition dynamics. To illustrate this point, in this paper we focus on the scenario in which loops of a new scalar field are responsible for the first-order phase transition, and study a selection of benchmark models with various SM gauge quantum numbers of the new scalar. We find that the current LHC measurement of the Higgs coupling to gluons already excludes the possibility of a first-order phase transition induced by a scalar in a sextet, or larger, representation of the SU(3)_c. Future LHC experiments (including HL-LHC) will be able to definitively probe the case when the new scalar is a color triplet. If the new scalar is not colored, an electron-positron Higgs factory, such as the proposed ILC or TLEP, would be required to test the nature of the phase transition. The extremely precise measurement of the Higgsstrahlung cross section possible at such machines will allow for a comprehensive and definitive probe of the possibility of a first-order electroweak phase transition in all models we considered, including the case when the new scalar is a pure gauge singlet.},

abstract = {Many strongly correlated electronic materials have a domain structure that greatly influences the bulk properties and obscures the fundamental properties of the homogeneous material. Nanoscale samples, on the other hand, can be smaller than the characteristic domain size, thus making it possible to explore these fundamental properties in detail. Here, we report new aspects of the metal–insulator transition1–3, studied in singledomain vanadium dioxide nanobeams4–6. We have observed supercooling of the metallic phase by 50 8C, an activation energy in the insulating phase that is consistent with the optical gap, and a connection between the metal–insulator transition and the equilibrium carrier density in the insulating phase. Our devices also provide a nanomechanical method for determining the transition temperature, enable measurements on individual metal–insulator interphase walls to be made, and allow general investigations of phase transitions in quasi-onedimensional geometries.},

abstract = {Low-temperature magnetic susceptibilities yield an effective magnetic moment per W atom of (3.24+0.10)p& for both WQ Q5VQ 9502 and WQ Q8VQ 9QO2 This value suggests a transfer of two d-shell electrons from the W to neighboring V ions to form V'+-W + and V +-V + pairs along the a axis of the monoclinic low-temperature phase. Studies of the extended x-ray-absorption fine-structure pat- tern for various compositions of different W-cation fraction x, and of the area of the W L&l&-edge resonance as well, confirm that the valence ofW is 6 + . Also, examination of the position of the V E edge versus composition for these alloys and other compounds indicates that the concentration of V + ions increases with W-cation fraction x. Thus, upon alloying VO2 with W, the reduction in the temperature of the metal-semiconductor transition by W appears to be due to charge transfer. From x-ray small-angle scattering it was found that there are no W-atom clusters present. The high-field magnetization at low temperature suggests that alloying causes this oxide to become a spin glass},

Further measurements demonstrate that this compound exhibits metallic conduction and Pauli paramagnetism from room temperature down to 2 K. From density functional theory calculations it is revealed that MgFeGe favors the same antiferromagnetic ground state magnetic configuration as LiFeAs. Moreover, considerable resemblance in the band dispersion, density of state, and Fermi surface was confirmed between MgFeGe and its isoelectronic superconducting counterpart LiFeAs. The results, however, suggest that the presence of the basic structural and electronic features of iron-based superconductors in MgFeGe does not necessarily lead to superconductivity, and further investigation is therefore still deserved to understand the related mechanisms.},

abstract = {Correlated electron materials can undergo a variety of phase transitions, including superconductivity, the metal-insulator transition and colossal magnetoresistance. Moreover, multiple physical phases or domains with dimensions of nanometres to micrometres can coexist in these materials at temperatures where a pure phase is expected. Making use of the properties of correlated electron materials in device applications will require the ability to control domain structures and phase transitions in these materials. Lattice strain has been shown to cause the coexistence of metallic and insulating phases in the Mott insulator VO(2). Here, we show that we can nucleate and manipulate ordered arrays of metallic and insulating domains along single-crystal beams of VO(2) by continuously tuning the strain over a wide range of values. The Mott transition between a low-temperature insulating phase and a high-temperature metallic phase usually occurs at 341 K in VO(2), but the active control of strain allows us to reduce this transition temperature to room temperature. In addition to device applications, the ability to control the phase structure of VO(2) with strain could lead to a deeper understanding of the correlated electron materials in general.},

abstract = {Strongly correlated insulators are broadly divided into two classes: Mott-Hubbard insulators, where the insulating gap is driven by the Coulomb repulsion U on the transition-metal cation, and charge-transfer insulators, where the gap is driven by the charge-transfer energy [Delta] between the cation and the ligand anions. The relative magnitudes of U and [Delta] determine which class a material belongs to, and subsequently the nature of its low-energy excitations. These energy scales are typically understood through the local chemistry of the active ions. Here we show that the situation is more complex in the low-dimensional charge-transfer insulator Li2CuO2, where [Delta] has a large non-electronic component. Combining resonant inelastic X-ray scattering with detailed modelling, we determine how the elementary lattice, charge, spin and orbital excitations are entangled in this material. This results in a large lattice-driven renormalization of [Delta], which significantly reshapes the fundamental electronic properties of Li2CuO2.},

A large reduction in the transition temperature TMI from 341 K for a single crystal to 300 K has been observed in the film on TiO2 (001) where the c-axis length is compressed owing to an epitaxial stress, while the TMI has been increased to 369 K in the film on TiO2 (110) where the c-axis length is expanded. The correlation between the c-axis length and TMI is suggested: the shorter c-axis length results in the lower TMI},

abstract = {Computing comprises three distinct strands: hardware, software and the ways they are used in real or imagined worlds. Its use in research is more than writing or running code. Having something significant to compute and deploying judgement in what is attempted and achieved are especially challenging. In science or engineering, one must define a central problem in computable form, run such software as is appropriate and, last but by no means least, convince others that the results are both valid and useful. These several strands are highly interdependent. A major scientific development can transform disparate aspects of information and computer technologies. Computers affect the way we do science, as well as changing our personal worlds. Access to information is being transformed, with consequences beyond research or even science. Creativity in research is usually considered uniquely human, with inspiration a central factor. Scientific and technological needs are major forces in innovation, and these include hardware and software opportunities. One can try to define the scientific needs for established technologies (atomic energy, the early semiconductor industry), for rapidly developing technologies (advanced materials, microelectronics) and for emerging technologies (nanotechnology, novel information technologies). Did these needs define new computing, or was science diverted into applications of then-available codes? Regarding credibility, why is it that engineers accept computer realizations when designing engineered structures, whereas predictive modelling of materials has yet to achieve industrial confidence outside very special cases? The tensions between computing and traditional science are complex, unpredictable and potentially powerful.},

abstract = {In the present study, we combine theoretical and experimental approaches in order to gain insight into the electronic properties of both the high-temperature, rutile (metallic) and low-temperature, body-centered tetragonal (insulating) phase of niobium dioxide (NbO2) as well as the optical properties of the low-temperature phase. Theoretical calculations performed at the level of the local density approximation, Hubbard U correction, and hybrid functional are complemented with the spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) of epitaxial films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. For the rutile phase, the local density approximation (LDA) gives the best description and predicts Fermi surface nesting consistent with wave vectors that lead to niobium-niobium dimerization during the phase transition. For the insulating phase, LDA provides a good quantitative description of the lattice, but only a qualitative description for the band gap. Including a Hubbard U correction opens the band gap at the expense of correctly describing the valence band and lattice of both phases. The hybrid functional slightly overestimates the band gap. Ellipsometric measurement is consistent with insulating behavior with a 1.0 eV band gap. Comparison with the theoretical dielectric functions, obtained utilizing a scissors operator to adjust the LDA band gap to reproduce the ellipsometry data, allows for identification of the SE peak features.

abstract = {Organolead halide perovskite is regarded as the most promising light-harvesting material for next-generation solar cells; however, the intrinsic instability and toxicity of lead are still of great concern. Bismuth is ecofriendly and has electronic properties similar to those of lead, which has gradually attracted interest for optoelectronic applications. However, the valence state of bismuth is different from that of lead, eliminating the possibility of replacing lead by bismuth in organolead halide perovskites. To address this matter, one feasible strategy is to construct B-site double perovskites by the combination of Bi3+ and B+ in 1:1 ratio. In this work, lead-free halide double perovskites of the form Cs2NaBX6 (B = Sb, Bi; X = Cl, Br, I) were investigated by first-principles calculations. The electronic properties, optical absorption coefficients, and thermodynamic stability of these compounds were investigated to ascertain their potential application in solar energy conversion. The results provide theoretical support for the exploration of lead-free perovskite materials in potential optoelectronic applications.},

In the cuprate high-temperature superconductor YBa(2)Cu(3)O(y) (YBCO), application of a magnetic field to suppress superconductivity reveals a ground state that appears to break the translational symmetry of the lattice, pointing to some density-wave order. Here we use a comparative study of thermoelectric transport in the cuprates YBCO and La(1.8-x)Eu(0.2)Sr(x)CuO(4) (Eu-LSCO) to show that the two materials exhibit the same process of Fermi-surface reconstruction as a function of temperature and doping.

abstract = {This paper contains a critique of the Brueckner-Goldstone perturbation series for the ground-state energy of an interacting gas of fermions. We have calculated this energy by 6rst constructing the grand partition function at finite temperature, and then carefully taking the limit as T->0. In general this leads to a series which differs from that of Brueckner and Goldstone. An exception is the case where both the unperturbed single-particle energy as well as the interaction potential have spherical symmetry. Reasons for the break- down of the Brueckner-Goldstone formalism are brieRy discussed.},

The main conceptual foundations are discussed in sections 2 and 3, which cover the momentum expansion and the most important issues associated with the renormalization process. Section 4 presents an overview of Chiral Perturbation Theory, the low-energy realization of Quantum Chromodynamics in the light quark sector. The Chiral Perturbation Theory framework is applied to weak transitions in section 5, where the physics of non-leptonic kaon decays is analyzed. The so-called Heavy Quark Effective Theory is briefly discussed in section 6. The electroweak chiral Effective Field Theory is described in section 7, which contains a brief overview of the effective Lagrangian associated with the spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking. Some summarizing comments are finally given in section 8.},

@article{Whittaker2011,
abstract = {The influence of finite size in altering the phase stabilities of strongly correlated materials gives rise to the interesting prospect of achieving additional tunability of solid–solid phase transitions such as those involved in metal–insulator switching, ferroelectricity, and superconductivity. We note here some distinctive finite size effects on the relative phase stabilities of insulating (monoclinic) and metallic (tetragonal) phases of solid-solution WxV1xO2. Ensemble differential scanning calorimetry and individual nanobelt electrical transport measurements suggest a pronounced hysteresis between metal /insulator and insulator/metal phase transformations. Both transitions are depressed to lower critical temperatures upon the incorporation of substitutional tungsten dopants but the impact on the former transition seems far more prominent. In general, the depression in the critical temperatures upon tungsten doping far exceeds corresponding values for bulkWxV1xO2 of the same composition. Notably, the depression in phase transition temperature saturates at a relatively low dopant concentration in the nanobelts, thought to be associated with the specific sites occupied by the tungsten substitutional dopants in these structures. The marked deviations from bulk behavior are rationalized in terms of a percolative model of the phase transition taking into account the nucleation of locally tetragonal domains and enhanced carrier delocalization that accompanyW6+ doping in the WxV1xO2 nanobelts},

abstract = {The recent discovery of superconductivity in the iron oxypnictide family of compounds has generated intense interest. The layered crystal structure with transition-metal ions in planar square-lattice form and the discovery of spin-density-wave order near 130 K (refs 10, 11) seem to hint at a strong similarity with the copper oxide superconductors. An important current issue is the nature of the ground state of the parent compounds. Two distinct classes of theories, distinguished by the underlying band structure, have been put forward: a local-moment antiferromagnetic ground state in the strong-coupling approach, and an itinerant ground state in the weak-coupling approach. The first approach stresses on-site correlations, proximity to a Mott-insulating state and, thus, the resemblance to the high-transition-temperature copper oxides, whereas the second approach emphasizes the itinerant-electron physics and the interplay between the competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic fluctuations. The debate over the two approaches is partly due to the lack of conclusive experimental information on the electronic structures. Here we report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) of LaOFeP (superconducting transition temperature, T(c) = 5.9 K), the first-reported iron-based superconductor. Our results favour the itinerant ground state, albeit with band renormalization. In addition, our data reveal important differences between these and copper-based superconductors.},

We analyze the model with the derived interactions together with the electronic repulsions within the random phase approximation. We find that the enhancement of the orbital fluctuations due to the electron-phonon interactions is small, making the spin fluctuations dominant. As a result, the superconducting state with the sign reversal in gap functions ({$}s{_}\backslashpm{\$}-wave) is realized.},

A plateau was detected in the stress-strain curve, signifying superelasticity of the nanowire arising from the M1-M2 structural phase transition. The transition was induced and controlled by uniaxial tension. The transition dynamics were characterized by a one-dimensionally aligned domain structure with pinning and depinning of the domain walls along the nanowire. From the stress-strain dependence the Young's moduli of the VO(2) M1 and M2 phases were estimated to be 128 ± 10 and 156 ± 10 GPa, respectively. Single pinning and depinning events of M1-M2 domain wall were observed in the superelastic regime, allowing for evaluation of the domain wall pinning potential energy. This study demonstrates a new way to investigate nanoscale mechanics and dynamics of structural phase transitions in general.},

abstract = {Attempts to avoid the divergence difficulties of quantum electrodynamics by multilation of the theory have been uniformly unsuccessful. The lack of convergence does indicate that a revision of electrodynamic concepts at ultrarelativistic energies is indeed necessary, but no appreciable alteration of the theory for moderate relativistic energies can be tolerated. The elementary phenomena in which divergences occur, in consequence of virtual transitions involving particles with unlimited energy, are the polarization of the vacuum and the self-energy of the electron, effects which essentially express the interaction of the electromagnetic and matter fields with their own vacuum fluctuations. The basic result of these fluctuation interactions is to alter the constants characterizing the properties of the individual fields, and their mutual coupling, albeit by infinite factors. The question is naturally posed whether all divergences can be isolated in such unobservable renormalization factors; more specifically, we inquire whether quantum electrodynamics can account unambiguously for the recently observed deviations from the Dirac electron theory, without the introduction of fundamentally new concepts. This paper, the first in a series devoted to the above question, is occupied with the formulation of a completely covariant electrodynamics. Manifest covariance with respect to Lorentz and gauge transformations is essential in a divergent theory since the use of a particular reference system or gauge in the course of calculation can result in a loss of covariance in view of the ambiguities that may be the concomitant of infinities. It is remarked, in the first section, that the customary canonical commutation relations, which fail to exhibit the desired covariance since they refer to field variables at equal times and different points of space, can be put in covariant form by replacing the four-dimensional surface t=const. by a space-like surface. The latter is such that light signals cannot be propagated between any two points on the surface. In this manner, a formulation of quantum electrodynamics is constructed in the Heisenberg representation, which is obviously covariant in all its aspects. It is not entirely suitable, however, as a practical means of treating electrodynamic questions, since commutators of field quantities at points separated by a time-like interval can be constructed only by solving the equations of motion. This situation is to be contrasted with that of the Schr{{{\"{o}}}}dinger representation, in which all operators refer to the same time, thus providing a distinct separation between kinematical and dynamical aspects. A formulation that retains the evident covariance of the Heisenberg representation, and yet offers something akin to the advantage of the Schr{{{\"{o}}}}dinger representation can be based on the distinction between the properties of non-interacting fields, and the effects of coupling between fields. In the second section, we construct a canonical transformation that changes the field equations in the Heisenberg representation into those of non-interacting fields, and therefore describes the coupling between fields in terms of a varying state vector. It is then a simple matter to evaluate commutators of field quantities at arbitrary space-time points. One thus obtains an obviously convariant and practical form of quantum electrodynamics, expressed in a mixed Heisenberg-Schr{{{\"{o}}}}dinger representation, which is called the interaction representation. The third section is devoted to a discussion of the covariant elimination of the longitudinal field, in which the customary distinction between longitudinal and transverse fields is replaced by a suitable covariant definition. The fourth section is concerned with the description of collision processes in terms of an invariant collision operator, which is the unitary operator that determines the over-all change in state of a system as the result of interaction. It is shown that the collision operator is simply related to the Hermitian reaction operator, for which a variational principle is constructed.},

@article{Pouget1974,
abstract = {The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of V" has been studied in the series of compounds V, „Cr„02 between 100 and 350 K. Three insulating phases are clearly distinguished. In the low-temperature M, phase only one V site is seen with a positive Knight shift and electric-field gradient identical to the insulating phase of pure VO,. At temperatures just below the metal-insulator transition a second phase M, is stable in which two sites are resolved. One site has a small positive Knight-shift characteristic of a paired V'+ site while the other has a negative Knight shift showing a localized V'+ site. These two sites are identified as the V atoms on the paired chains and the equispaced chains in C2/m structure of Marezio et al. At intermediate temperatures a transitional phase T is stable in which two sites can be resolved by their electric-field gradients. The two sites are progressively differentiated by increasing temperature and Cr concentration and are interpreted as arising from two sets of inequivalent paired chains, one of which is depairing with increasing temperature and Cr concentration. These results are inconsistent with the monoclinic symmetry and a disordered bond model proposed previously for the transitional phase. Triclinic splittings were observed recently by Villeneuve et al. and additional crystallographic evidence supporting this result is presented. The magnetic properties are interpreted as a set of noninteracting linear Heisenberg chains and the M,-T transition as a dimerization of the linear Heisenberg chain. The results demonstrate a breakdown of the band model in the insulating phases.},

@article{Schwinger1949,
abstract = {The discussion of vacuum polarization in the previous paper of this series was confined to that produced by the field of a prescribed current distribution. We now consider the induction of current in the vacuum by an electron, which is a dynamical system and an entity indistinguishable from the particles associated with vacuum fluctuations. The additional current thus attributed to an electron implies an alteration in its electromagnetic properties which will be revealed by scattering in a Coulomb field and by energy level displacements. This paper is concerned with the computation of the second-order corrections to the current operator and the application to electron scattering. Radiative corrections to energy levels will be treated in the next paper of the series. Following a canonical transformation which effectively renormalizes the electron mass, the correction to the current operator produced by the coupling with the electromagnetic field is developed in a power series, of which first- and second-order terms are retained. One thus obtains second-order modifications in the current operator which are of the same general nature as the previously treated vacuum polarization current, save for a contribution that has the form of a dipole current. The latter implies a fractional increase of $\alpha$/2$\pi$ in the spin magnetic moment of the electron. The only flaw in the second-order current correction is a logarithmic divergence attributable to an infra-red catastrophe. It is remarked that, in the presence of an external field, the first-order current correction will introduce a compensating divergence. Thus, the second-order corrections to particle electromagnetic properties cannot be completely stated without regard for the manner of exhibiting them by an external field. Accordingly, we consider in the second section the interaction of three systems, the matter field, the electromagnetic field, and a given current distribution. It is shown that this situation can be described in terms of an external potential coupled to the current operator, as modified by the interaction with the vacuum electromagnetic field. Application is made to the scattering of an electron by an external field, in which the latter is regarded as a small perturbation. It is found convenient to calculate the total rate at which collisions occur and then identify the cross sections for individual events. The correction to the cross section for radiationless scattering is determined by the second-order correction to the current operator, while scattering that is accompanied by single quantum emission is a consequence of the first-order current correction. The final object of calculation is the differential cross section for scattering through a given angle with a prescribed maximum energy loss, which is completely free of divergences. Detailed evaluations are given in two situations, the essentially elastic scattering of an electron, in which only a small fraction of the kinetic energy is radiated, and the scattering of a slowly moving electron with unrestricted energy loss. The Appendix is devoted to an alternative treatment of the polarization of the vacuum by an external field. The conditions imposed on the induced current by the charge conservation and gauge invariance requirements are examined. It is found that the fulfillment of these formal properties requires the vanishing of an integral that is not absolutely convergent, but naturally vanishes for reasons of symmetry. This null integral is then used to simplify the expression for the induced current in such a manner that direct calculation yields a gauge invariant result. The induced current contains a logarithmically divergent multiple of the external current, which implies that a non-vanishing total charge, proportional to the external charge, is induced in the vacuum. The apparent contradiction with charge conservation is resolved by showing that a compensating charge escapes to infinity. Finally, the expression for the electromagnetic mass of the electron is treated with the methods developed in this paper.},

abstract = {The characterization of a material as metallic or insulating, the study of transitions between such states, and the development of models for such transitions is of great fundamental and practical interest. The one-band Hubbard model is potentially relevant in this context since its primary parameter, the on-site interaction, triggers a transition or a crossover from metallic to insulating behavior at half filling. A reduction of complexity is achieved by the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT); due to its nonperturbative character, this method is reliable in the range of interest, i.e., for intermediate to strong coupling. It becomes exact in the limit of high dimensionality (or large coordination number). This work focuses on strongly correlated electron systems near a Mott metal-insulator transition. In the pedagogical chapter 1, we introduce the general electronic Hamiltonian and its reduction to the Hubbard model. We characterize the DMFT and its relation with mean-field approximations to spin systems and present the mean-field equations as well as their numerical solution using the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method. Finally, we discuss the analytic continuation of imaginary-time Green functions by the maximum entropy method (MEM). In chapter 2, we study the relations between lattice types, frustration, and densities of states (DOS). On the basis of Monte Carlo computations of momentum sums, we also evaluate the convergence of the DOS to its infinite-dimensional (d = ∞) limit. We present new insights on the “Bethe lattice” and on the impact of longer-range hopping for this model. A new formalism is developed that allows to construct models with hypercubic symmetry which reproduce an arbitrary target DOS in d = ∞. Using this approach, we can for the first time define a regular lattice with semi-elliptic DOS in d = ∞. In the central chapter 3, we thoroughly explore the low-temperature properties of the fully frustrated Hubbard model with semi-elliptic DOS within the DMFT. The boundaries of a coexistence region of metallic and insulating solutions are determined with high accuracy, thereby resolving a controversy on the existence of a first-order transition within this model. We correct deficiencies in previously used QMC schemes and formulate an improved criterion for the detection of phase transitions. Going beyond previous work, the first-order transition line is accurately determined using a newly developed formalism. Finally, we suggest further methodological improvements and compute local MEM spectra with high precision. Transport properties are discussed in chapter 4, where we review and extend the relevant formalisms. We derive new expressions for the optical f-sum rule in d = ∞. Fully lattice specific calculations of the optical conductivity are shown to be essential; errors made in earlier studies of frustration are quantified. We point out the ambiguities associated with any DMFT calculation of transport properties for “the Bethe lattice” and review possible concepts for making the problem well-defined; the regular lattice defined in chapter 2 is seen to have the most desirable properties. We then present accurate numerical results for the optical conductivity which are based on the MEM spectra computed in chapter 3. The thesis closes with chapter 5, where we review the density functional theory and its local density approximation (LDA) and introduce the recently developed hybrid LDA+DMFT scheme. We discuss the solution using QMC as well as the extraction of photoemission and X-ray absorption spectra. Numerical results for the doped transition metal oxide La1-xSrxTiO3 with controlled precision are compared with experiments. Finally, a definition of the optical conductivity compatible with the LDA DOS is derived using the formalism developed in chapter 2; corresponding numerical results on the basis of MEM spectra are presented.},

abstract = {The abrupt first-order metal-insulator phase transition in single-crystal vanadium dioxide nanowires (NWs) is engineered to be a gradual transition by axially grading the doping level of tungsten. We also demonstrate the potential of these NWs for thermal sensing and actuation applications. At room temperature, the graded-doped NWs show metal phase on the tips and insulator phase near the center of the NW, and the metal phase grows progressively toward the center when the temperature rises. As such, each individual NW acts as a microthermometer that can be simply read out with an optical microscope. The NW resistance decreases gradually with the temperature rise, eventually reaching 2 orders of magnitude drop, in stark contrast to the abrupt resistance change in undoped VO2 wires. This novel phase transition yields an extremely high temperature coefficient of resistivity $\sim$10%/K, simultaneously with a very low resistivity down to 0.001 $\Omega${{\textperiodcentered}}cm, making these NWs promising infrared sensing materials for uncooled microbolometers. Lastly, they form bimorph thermal actuators that bend with an unusually high curvature, $\sim$900 m(-1){{\textperiodcentered}}K(-1) over a wide temperature range (35-80 °C), significantly broadening the response temperature range of previous VO2 bimorph actuators. Given that the phase transition responds to a diverse range of stimuli-heat, electric current, strain, focused light, and electric field-the graded-doped NWs may find wide applications in thermo-opto-electro-mechanical sensing and energy conversion.},

abstract = {Correlated electron materials can undergo a variety of phase transitions, including superconductivity, the metal-insulator transition and colossal magnetoresistance. Moreover, multiple physical phases or domains with dimensions of nanometres to micrometres can coexist in these materials at temperatures where a pure phase is expected. Making use of the properties of correlated electron materials in device applications will require the ability to control domain structures and phase transitions in these materials. Lattice strain has been shown to cause the coexistence of metallic and insulating phases in the Mott insulator VO(2). Here, we show that we can nucleate and manipulate ordered arrays of metallic and insulating domains along single-crystal beams of VO(2) by continuously tuning the strain over a wide range of values. The Mott transition between a low-temperature insulating phase and a high-temperature metallic phase usually occurs at 341 K in VO(2), but the active control of strain allows us to reduce this transition temperature to room temperature. In addition to device applications, the ability to control the phase structure of VO(2) with strain could lead to a deeper understanding of the correlated electron materials in general.},

abstract = {Close to optimal doping, the copper oxide superconductors show 'strange metal' behaviour, suggestive of strong fluctuations associated with a quantum critical point. Such a critical point requires a line of classical phase transitions terminating at zero temperature near optimal doping inside the superconducting 'dome'. The underdoped region of the temperature-doping phase diagram from which superconductivity emerges is referred to as the 'pseudogap' because evidence exists for partial gapping of the conduction electrons, but so far there is no compelling thermodynamic evidence as to whether the pseudogap is a distinct phase or a continuous evolution of physical properties on cooling. Here we report that the pseudogap in YBa2Cu3O6+$\delta$ is a distinct phase, bounded by a line of phase transitions. The doping dependence of this line is such that it terminates at zero temperature inside the superconducting dome. From this we conclude that quantum criticality drives the strange metallic behaviour and therefore superconductivity in the copper oxide superconductors.},

abstract = {The Yang-Mills description of phonons and the consequent structure of electron liquids in strongly anharmonic crystals such as metal oxides is shown to yield an attractive electron-phonon interaction, and thus an instability towards the formation of bound states, which can condense to form a superconductor. This mechanism differs significantly from the pairing mechanism of conventional superconductivity: the ground state from which superconductivity emerges is a complicated many-body state of paired electrons and holes which is not amenable to a quasiparticle description, and whose properties are similar to those seen in the Cuprate high temperature superconductors. Confinement arises because the complicated electron liquid structure acts as a source for Yang-Mills bosons, and not the traditional longitudinal density waves of BCS pairing.},

In case of HTSC cuprates, we summarize and discuss a consistent view of electronic interactions that provides natural explanation of both the origin of the pseudogap state and the mechanism for high temperature superconductivity. Within this scenario, the spin-fluctuations play a decisive role in formation of the fermionic excitation spectrum in the normal state and are sufficient to explain the high transition temperatures to the superconducting state while the pseudogap phenomenon is a consequence of a Peierls-type intrinsic instability of electronic system to formation of an incommensurate density wave. On the other hand, a similar analysis being applied to the iron pnictides reveals especially strong electron-phonon coupling that suggests important role of phonons for high-Tc superconductivity in pnictides.},

abstract = {X-ray spectroscopy is a powerful and widely used tool for the investigation of the electronic structure of a large variety of solid-state materials, including crystals, liquids, amorphous solids, molecules, and extended states such as clusters or interfaces. The local nature of x-ray mediated electronic excitations, involving transitions to or from localized, atomic-like, core levels, makes them ideal probes of local electronic properties: bonding character, charge transfer, and local geometry. The interpretation of spectra relies on modeling the excitations accurately to provide a concrete connection between specific properties of a system and the resulting x-ray spectrum. As experimental techniques and facilities have improved, including third generation synchrotron sources and the advent of x-ray free-electron lasers, measurements have been taken on wider ranges of systems, exploring the effects of temperature and pressure, and at higher resolutions than before, but theoretical techniques have lagged. Our goal is to develop a first-principles the- oretical framework capable of achieving quantitative agreement with x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) experiments. This thesis aims to develop the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE), a particle-hole Green's function method, for describing the excited electronic state produced in core-level x-ray absorption and related spectroscopies. Building upon density functional the- ory along with self-energy corrections, our approach provides connection to experiment with minimal adjustable parameters, to both aid in interpretation and highlight unaccounted for phys- ical processes. While a fully parameter-free method for calculating x-ray spectroscopy remains elusive, our method presented here allows for quantitative comparison to experiment without system-dependent fits. This method has been implemented in the OCEAN software package, and results are presented for both insulating and metallic materials, including 3d transition metal and water systems.},

abstract = {We investigate the effect of systematically applying molecular dynamics (MD) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) to docked poses in an attempt to improve the correspondence between theoretical prediction and experimental observation. The proposed scheme involves running a short time scale MD simulation on a docked ligand pose (and any known structurally important crystal structure waters in the active site), followed by QM/MM minimization. Both of these steps are relatively fast for moderately sized ligands; longer time scale MD involving the protein is not found to improve the results. The final binding energy is given in terms of the QM/MM total energy, a van der Waals correction, and a term to account for desolvation effects. This methodology is first tested with a trypsin inhibitor, for which we establish the importance of running MD before reoptimizing with QM/MM. The method is then applied to cytochrome c peroxidase using a set of binders and decoys. In this example, the proposed methodology affords much better discrimination between binders and decoys than the traditional docking approach used. For both systems presented, application of this protocol results in a significantly better energetic ranking and a smaller root mean squared deviation from known crystallographic ligand poses. This work highlights the importance of including polarization effects through QM/MM and of sampling with MD to refine a set of initial docked poses.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Lead halide perovskites are used in thin-film solar cells, which owe their high efficiency to the long lifetimes of photocarriers. Various calculations find that a dynamical Rashba effect could significantly contribute to these long lifetimes. This effect is predicted to cause a spin splitting of the electronic bands of inversion-symmetric crystalline materials at finite temperatures, resulting in a slightly indirect band gap. Direct experimental evidence of the existence or the strength of the spin splitting is lacking. Here, we resonantly excite photocurrents in single crystalline (CH 3 NH 3 )PbI 3 with circularly polarized light to clarify the existence of spin splittings in the band structure. We observe a circular photogalvanic effect, i.e., the photocurrent depends on the light helicity, in both orthorhombic and tetragonal (CH 3 NH 3 )PbI 3 . At room temperature, the effect peaks for excitation photon energies ∆E = 110 meV below the direct optical band gap. Temperature-dependent measurements reveal a sign change of the effect at the orthorhombic–tetragonal phase transition, indicating different microscopic origins in the two phases. Within the tetragonal phase, both ∆E and the amplitude of the circular photogalvanic effect increase with temperature. Our findings support a dynamical Rashba effect in this phase, i.e., a spin splitting caused by thermally induced structural fluctuations which break inversion symmetry.},

abstract = {The electronic ground state of a periodic system is usually described in terms of extended Bloch orbitals, simultaneous eigenstates of the periodic Hamiltonian and of the direct lattice translations. An alternative representation in terms of localized orbitals has been introduced by Gregory Wannier in 1937; besides its theoretical relevance in several areas of solid-state theory, it has gained recent prominence due to its connection with the Berry-phase theory of bulk polarization, the interest in linear-scaling approaches, and with the development of general algorithms to derive Wannier functions in the framework of first-principles electronic structure calculations. The connection between the Bloch representation and the Wannier representation is realized by families of transformations in a continuous space of unitary matrices, carrying a large degree of arbitrariness. A few years ago we have developed a localization algorithm that allows one to iteratively transform the extended Bloch orbitals of a first-principles calculation into a unique set of maximally-localized Wannier functions (MLWFs), extending and encompassing Boys formulation for molecules to the solid-state case. The localization algorithm is independent of the single-particle electronic structure approach adopted, or the choice of basis set, and it is straightforwardly applied to extended or periodic solids and to isolated systems. Additionally, a novel disentanglement procedure allows to extract a maximally-connected manifold of any chosen dimension from a given energy window, leading to the extension of the original algorithm to the case of systems without gaps (e.g., metals) and removing the limitation to isolated groups of bands separated by gaps from higher and lower manifolds. In this Highlight we will outline and summarize the main results of the theory and algorithm underlying the maximally-localized Wannier- functions representation, and review some of the applications that have since appeared in the literature.},

abstract = {A method to analyze powder-diffraction line broadening is proposed and applied to some novel high-T(c) superconductors. Assuming that both size-broadened and strain-broadened profiles of the pure-specimen profile are described with a Voigt function, it is shown that the analysis of Fourier coefficients leads to the Warren-Averbach method of separation of size and strain contributions. The analysis of size coefficients shows that the ''hook'' effect occurs when the Cauchy content of the size-broadened profile is underestimated. The ratio of volume-weighted and surface-weighted domain sizes can change from approximately 1.31 for the minimum allowed Cauchy content to 2 when the size-broadened profile is given solely by a Cauchy function. If the distortion coefficient is approximated by a harmonic term, mean-square strains decrease linearly with the increase of the averaging distance. The local strain is finite only in the case of pure-Gauss strain broadening because strains are then independent of averaging distance. Errors of root-mean-square strains as well as domain sizes were evaluated. The method was applied to two cubic structures with average volume-weighted domain sizes up to 3600 angstrom as well as to tetragonal and orthorhombic (La-Sr)2CuO4, which exhibit weak line broadenings and highly overlapping reflections. Comparison with the integral-breadth methods is given. Reliability of the method is discussed in the case of a cluster of the overlapping peaks. The analysis of La2CuO4 and La1.85M0.15CuO4(M=Ca, Ba, Sr) high-T(c) superconductors showed that microstrains and incoherently diffracting domain sizes are highly anisotropic. In the superconductors, stacking-fault probability increases with increasing T(c); microstrain decreases. In La2CuO4, different broadening of (h00) and (0k0) reflections is not caused by stacking faults; it might arise from lower crystallographic symmetry. The analysis of Bi-Cu-O superconductors showed much higher strains in the [001] direction than in the basal a-b plane. This may be caused by stacking disorder along the c-axis, because of the two-dimensional weakly bonded BiO double layers. Results for the specimen containing two related high-T(c) phases indicate a possible mechanism for the phase transformation by the growth of faulted regions of the major phase.},

E.P.R. and resistivity measurements indicate a decrease in the metallic character of the high-temperature R phase with increasing x, and calorimetric measurements of the energetics of the transition show a decrease in the enthalpy and entropy of the transition with increasing levels of doping. This concomitant decrease in enthalpy and metallic character with increasing x implies a strong contribution of the electronic entropy to the transition. An extrapolation of the combined electronic and calorimetric data for GaxV-xO2 to pure VO2 suggest that the electronic entropy comprises about 60% of the total entropy of transition in VO2. ?? 1978.},

We get a general picture that the gap function and the strength of the superconducting instability are determined by multiple spin fluctuation modes arising from several nestings among disconnected pieces of the Fermi surface, which work constructively or competitively as dictated by the lattice structure. Specifically, the appearance of the Fermi surface around ( $\pi$ , $\pi$ ) in the unfolded Brillouin zone is sensitive to the pnictogen height h Pn above the Fe plane, where h Pn is shown to act as a switch between high- T c nodeless and low- T c nodal pairings.},

abstract = {Many theoretical models of high-temperature superconductivity focus only on the doping dependence of the CuO(2)-plane electronic structure. However, such models are manifestly insufficient to explain the strong variations in superconducting critical temperature, T(c), among cuprates that have identical hole density but are crystallographically different outside of the CuO(2) plane. A key challenge, therefore, has been to identify a predominant out-of-plane influence controlling the superconductivity, with much attention focusing on the distance d(A) between the apical oxygen and the planar copper atom. Here we report direct determination of how variations in interatomic distances within individual crystalline unit cells affect the superconducting energy-gap maximum Delta of Bi(2)Sr(2)CaCu(2)O(8+delta). In this material, quasiperiodic variations of unit cell geometry occur in the form of a bulk crystalline "supermodulation." Within each supermodulation period, we find approximately 9 +/- 1{%} cosinusoidal variation in local Delta that is anticorrelated with the associated d(A) variations. Furthermore, we show that phenomenological consistency would exist between these effects and the random Delta variations found near dopant atoms if the primary effect of the interstitial dopant atom is to displace the apical oxygen so as to diminish d(A) or tilt the CuO(5) pyramid. Thus, we reveal a strong, nonrandom out-of-plane effect on cuprate superconductivity at atomic scale.},

abstract = {The electronic ground state of a periodic system is usually described in terms of extended Bloch orbitals, but an alternative representation in terms of localized "Wannier functions" was introduced by Gregory Wannier in 1937. The connection between the Bloch and Wannier representations is realized by families of transformations in a continuous space of unitary matrices, carrying a large degree of arbitrariness. Since 1997, methods have been developed that allow one to iteratively transform the extended Bloch orbitals of a first-principles calculation into a unique set of maximally localized Wannier functions, accomplishing the solid-state equivalent of constructing localized molecular orbitals, or "Boys orbitals" as previously known from the chemistry literature. These developments are reviewed here, and a survey of the applications of these methods is presented. This latter includes a description of their use in analyzing the nature of chemical bonding, or as a local probe of phenomena related to electric polarization and orbital magnetization. Wannier interpolation schemes are also reviewed, by which quantities computed on a coarse reciprocal-space mesh can be used to interpolate onto much finer meshes at low cost, and applications in which Wannier functions are used as efficient basis functions are discussed. Finally the construction and use of Wannier functions outside the context of electronic-structure theory is presented, for cases that include phonon excitations, photonic crystals, and cold-atom optical lattices. {{\textcopyright}} 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The interaction of electromagnetic radiation with free electrons in the presence of an active medium has some appealing outcomes. Among them is particle acceleration by stimulated emission of radiation (PASER). In its framework, energy stored in an active medium (microscopic cavities) is transferred directly to an e -beam passing through. We have developed a two-dimensional analytic model for the evaluation of the energy exchange occurring as a train of electron microbunches traverses a dilute resonant medium. Efficient interaction occurs at resonance-namely, when the frequency of the train matches the resonance frequency of the medium. It is shown that the energy exchange is gamma independent for relativistic energies and it drops dramatically with an increase of the beam's radius. Based on this model, we have evaluated the relative change in the kinetic energy of a 0.1-nC 45-MeV macrobunch traversing an excited CO2 gas mixture-the former being modulated at the CO2 laser wavelength. Good agreement is found between the theoretical predictions and the results of the PASER experiment performed recently at Brookhaven National Laboratory.},

abstract = {We present comprehensive broadband optical spectroscopy data on two insulating phases of vanadium dioxide (VO2): monoclinic M2 and triclinic. The main result of our work is that the energy gap and the electronic structure are essentially unaltered by the first-order structural phase transition between the M2 and triclinic phases. Moreover, the optical interband features in the M2 and triclinic phases are remarkably similar to those observed in the well-studied monoclinic M1 insulating phase of VO2. As the energy gap is insensitive to the different lattice structures of the three insulating phases, we rule out vanadium-vanadium pairing (the Peierls component) as the dominant contributor to the opening of the gap. Rather, the energy gap arises primarily from intra-atomic Coulomb correlations.},

abstract = {Doping organic metal-halide perovskites with cesium could be the best solution to stabilize highly-efficient perovskite solar cells. The understanding of the respective roles of the organic molecule, on one hand, and the inorganic lattice, on the other hand, is thus crucial to be able to optimize the physical properties of the mixed cation structures. In particular, the study of the recombination mechanisms is thought to be one of the key challenges toward full comprehension of their working principles. Using molecular dynamics and frozen phonons, we evidence subpicosecond anharmonic fluctuations in the fully inorganic CsPbI 3 perovskite. We reveal the effect of these fluctuations, combined with spin-orbit coupling, on the electronic band structure, evidencing a dynamical Rashba effect. Our study shows that under certain conditions space disorder can quench the Rashba effect. As for time disorder, we evidence a dynamical Rashba effect which is similar to what was found for MAPbI 3 and which is still sizable despite temperature disorder, the large investigated supercell, and the absence of the organic cations' motion. We show that the spin texture associated with the Rashba splitting cannot be deemed responsible for a consistent reduction of recombination rates, although the spin mismatch between the valence and conduction bands increases with the ferroelectric distortion causing the Rashba splitting.},

abstract = {Several Tl and Pb based halides and chalcohalides have recently been discovered as promising optoelectronic materials [i.e., photovoltaic (PV) and gamma-ray detection materials]. Efficient carrier transport in these materials is attributed partly to the special chemistry of ns2 ions (e.g., Tl+, Pb2+, and Bi3+). However, the toxicity of Tl and Pb is challenging to the development and the wide use of Tl and Pb based materials. In this paper, we investigate materials that contain Bi3+, which is also an ns2 ion. By combining Bi halides with Bi chalcogenides or oxides, the resulting ternary compounds exhibit a wide range of band gaps, offering opportunities in various optoelectronic applications. Density functional calculations of electronic structure, dielectric properties, optical properties, and defect properties are performed on selected Bi3+ based chalcohalides and oxyhalides, i.e., BiSeBr, BiSI, BiSeI, and BiOBr. We propose different applications for these Bi compounds based on calculated properties, i.e., n-BiSeBr, p-BiSI, and p-BiSeI as PV materials, BiSeBr and BiSI as room-temperature radiation detection materials, and BiOBr as a p-type transparent conducting material. BiSeBr, BiSI, and BiSeBr have chain structures while BiOBr has a layered structure. However, in BiSI, BiSeI, and BiOBr, significant valence-band dispersion is found in the directions perpendicular to the atomic chain or layer because the valence-band edge states are dominated by the halogen states that have strong interchain or interlayer coupling. We find significantly enhanced Born effective charges and anomalously large static dielectric constants of the Bi compounds, which should reduce carrier scattering and trapping and promote efficient carrier transport in these materials. The strong screening and the small anion coordination numbers in Bi chalcohalides should lead to weak potentials for electron localization at anion vacancies. Defect calculations indeed show that the anion vacancies (Se and Br vacancies) in BiSeBr are shallow, which is beneficial to efficient electron transport.},

abstract = {Kamihara and coworkers' report of superconductivity at Tc = 26 K in fluorine-doped LaFeAsO inspired a worldwide effort to understand the nature of the superconductivity in this new class of compounds. These iron pnictide and chalcogenide (FePn/Ch) superconductors have Fe electrons at the Fermi surface, plus an unusual Fermiology that can change rapidly with doping, which lead to normal and superconducting state properties very different from those in standard electron-phonon coupled 'conventional' superconductors. Clearly superconductivity and magnetism/magnetic fluctuations are intimately related in the FePn/Ch - and even coexist in some. Open questions, including the superconducting nodal structure in a number of compounds, abound and are often dependent on improved sample quality for their solution. With Tc values up to 56 K, the six distinct Fe-containing superconducting structures exhibit complex but often comparable behaviors. The search for correlations and explanations in this fascinating field of research would benefit from an organization of the large, seemingly disparate data set. This review attempts to provide an overview, using numerous references, with a focus on the materials and their superconductivity.},

In one dimension, the electrons may be strictly correlated at all finite densities.

abstract = {A method to analyze powder-diffraction line broadening is proposed and applied to some novel high-T(c) superconductors. Assuming that both size-broadened and strain-broadened profiles of the pure-specimen profile are described with a Voigt function, it is shown that the analysis of Fourier coefficients leads to the Warren-Averbach method of separation of size and strain contributions. The analysis of size coefficients shows that the ''hook'' effect occurs when the Cauchy content of the size-broadened profile is underestimated. The ratio of volume-weighted and surface-weighted domain sizes can change from approximately 1.31 for the minimum allowed Cauchy content to 2 when the size-broadened profile is given solely by a Cauchy function. If the distortion coefficient is approximated by a harmonic term, mean-square strains decrease linearly with the increase of the averaging distance. The local strain is finite only in the case of pure-Gauss strain broadening because strains are then independent of averaging distance. Errors of root-mean-square strains as well as domain sizes were evaluated. The method was applied to two cubic structures with average volume-weighted domain sizes up to 3600 angstrom as well as to tetragonal and orthorhombic (La-Sr)2CuO4, which exhibit weak line broadenings and highly overlapping reflections. Comparison with the integral-breadth methods is given. Reliability of the method is discussed in the case of a cluster of the overlapping peaks. The analysis of La2CuO4 and La1.85M0.15CuO4(M=Ca, Ba, Sr) high-T(c) superconductors showed that microstrains and incoherently diffracting domain sizes are highly anisotropic. In the superconductors, stacking-fault probability increases with increasing T(c); microstrain decreases. In La2CuO4, different broadening of (h00) and (0k0) reflections is not caused by stacking faults; it might arise from lower crystallographic symmetry. The analysis of Bi-Cu-O superconductors showed much higher strains in the [001] direction than in the basal a-b plane. This may be caused by stacking disorder along the c-axis, because of the two-dimensional weakly bonded BiO double layers. Results for the specimen containing two related high-T(c) phases indicate a possible mechanism for the phase transformation by the growth of faulted regions of the major phase.},

Specifically, the appearance of the Fermi surface around ( $\pi$ , $\pi$ ) in the unfolded Brillouin zone is sensitive to the pnictogen height h Pn above the Fe plane, where h Pn is shown to act as a switch between high- T c nodeless and low- T c nodal pairings.},

abstract = {The characterization of a material as metallic or insulating, the study of transitions between such states, and the development of models for such transitions is of great fundamental and practical interest. The one-band Hubbard model is potentially relevant in this context since its primary parameter, the on-site interaction, triggers a transition or a crossover from metallic to insulating behavior at half filling. A reduction of complexity is achieved by the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT); due to its nonperturbative character, this method is reliable in the range of interest, i.e., for intermediate to strong coupling. It becomes exact in the limit of high dimensionality (or large coordination number). This work focuses on strongly correlated electron systems near a Mott metal-insulator transition. In the pedagogical chapter 1, we introduce the general electronic Hamiltonian and its reduction to the Hubbard model. We characterize the DMFT and its relation with mean-field approximations to spin systems and present the mean-field equations as well as their numerical solution using the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method. Finally, we discuss the analytic continuation of imaginary-time Green functions by the maximum entropy method (MEM). In chapter 2, we study the relations between lattice types, frustration, and densities of states (DOS). On the basis of Monte Carlo computations of momentum sums, we also evaluate the convergence of the DOS to its infinite-dimensional (d = ∞) limit. We present new insights on the “Bethe lattice” and on the impact of longer-range hopping for this model. A new formalism is developed that allows to construct models with hypercubic symmetry which reproduce an arbitrary target DOS in d = ∞. Using this approach, we can for the first time define a regular lattice with semi-elliptic DOS in d = ∞. In the central chapter 3, we thoroughly explore the low-temperature properties of the fully frustrated Hubbard model with semi-elliptic DOS within the DMFT. The boundaries of a coexistence region of metallic and insulating solutions are determined with high accuracy, thereby resolving a controversy on the existence of a first-order transition within this model. We correct deficiencies in previously used QMC schemes and formulate an improved criterion for the detection of phase transitions. Going beyond previous work, the first-order transition line is accurately determined using a newly developed formalism. Finally, we suggest further methodological improvements and compute local MEM spectra with high precision. Transport properties are discussed in chapter 4, where we review and extend the relevant formalisms. We derive new expressions for the optical f-sum rule in d = ∞. Fully lattice specific calculations of the optical conductivity are shown to be essential; errors made in earlier studies of frustration are quantified. We point out the ambiguities associated with any DMFT calculation of transport properties for “the Bethe lattice” and review possible concepts for making the problem well-defined; the regular lattice defined in chapter 2 is seen to have the most desirable properties. We then present accurate numerical results for the optical conductivity which are based on the MEM spectra computed in chapter 3. The thesis closes with chapter 5, where we review the density functional theory and its local density approximation (LDA) and introduce the recently developed hybrid LDA+DMFT scheme. We discuss the solution using QMC as well as the extraction of photoemission and X-ray absorption spectra. Numerical results for the doped transition metal oxide La1-xSrxTiO3 with controlled precision are compared with experiments. Finally, a definition of the optical conductivity compatible with the LDA DOS is derived using the formalism developed in chapter 2; corresponding numerical results on the basis of MEM spectra are presented.},

This large variation, however, is not well understood. We investigate the relationship between the electronic band structures and exciton binding energies in semiconductors, employing first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory and the many-body perturbation theory using Green's functions. Our results clearly show that Eb increases as the localization of valence electrons increases due to the reduced electronic screening. Furthermore, Eb increases in ionic semiconductors such as ZnO because, contrary to the simple two-level coupling model, it has both conduction and valence band edge states strongly localized on anion sites, leading to an enhanced electron-hole interaction. These trends are quantized by electronic structures obtained from the density functional theory; thus, our approach can be applied to understand the excitonic effects in complex semiconducting materials. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

Energy-band calculations using hybrid exchange functionals or including self-energy corrections account for the insulating or metallic nature of different phases but have not yet successfully accounted for the observed magnetic orderings. Strongly correlated theories have had limited quantitative success. Here we report that by using hard pseudopotentials and an optimized hybrid exchange functional, the energy gaps and magnetic orderings of both monoclinic VO 2 phases and the metallic nature of the high-temperature rutile phase are consistent with available experimental data, obviating an explicit role for strong correlations. We also identify a potential candidate for the newly found metallic monoclinic phase.},

An emerging trend documented in heavy-fermion and organic conductors is that the maximum T(c) for superconductivity occurs under external conditions that cause the critical temperature for a competing order to go to zero. Recently, such competition has been found in multilayer copper oxide high-temperature superconductors (HTSCs) that possess two crystallographically inequivalent CuO(2) planes in the unit cell. However, whether the competing electronic state can be suppressed to enhance T(c) in HTSCs remains an open question. Here we show that pressure-driven phase competition leads to an unusual two-step enhancement of T(c) in optimally doped trilayer Bi(2)Sr(2)Ca(2)Cu(3)O(10+delta) (Bi2223). We find that T(c) first increases with pressure and then decreases after passing through a maximum. Unexpectedly, T(c) increases again when the pressure is further raised above a critical value of around 24 GPa, surpassing the first maximum. The presence of this critical pressure is a manifestation of the crossover from the competing order to superconductivity in the inner of the three CuO(2) planes. We suggest that the increase at higher pressures occurs as a result of competition between pairing and phase ordering in different CuO(2) planes.},

Unusually large and controllable changes in resonator frequency were observed due to the influences of domain wall motion and anomalous phonon softening on the effective modulus. In addition, extraordinary static and dynamic displacements were generated by local strain gradients, suggesting new classes of sensors and nanoelectromechanical devices with programmable discrete outputs as a function of continuous inputs.},

By examining its dependence on photon energy, polarization, sodium dosing and the counting of Fermi surface volume, both the bulk and the surface contributions are identified. We find that a bulk band moves toward high binding energies below structural transition, and shifts smoothly across the spin density wave transition by about 25 meV. Our data suggest the band reconstruction may play a crucial role in the spin density wave transition, and the structural transition is driven by the short range magnetic order. For the surface states, both the LaO-terminated and FeAs-terminated components are revealed. Certain small band shifts are verified for the FeAs-terminated surface states in the spin density wave state, which is a reflection of the bulk electronic structure reconstruction. Moreover, sharp quasiparticle peaks quickly rise at low temperatures, indicating of drastic reduction of the scattering rate. A kink structure in one of the surface band is shown to be possibly related to the electron-phonon interactions.},

Within the generalized gradient approximation, the 1T polytype is highly unstable with respect to the 2H. The DFT+U method improves the stability of the 1T phase, explaining its detection in experiments. A charge density wave occurs with a $\sqrt{13}\times\sqrt{13}\simR30^{\circ}$ periodicity, in agreement with STM data. At $U=0$, the David-star reconstruction displays a flat band below the Fermi level with a marked d$_{z^2-r^2}$ orbital character of the central Nb. The Hubbard interaction induces a magnetic Mott insulating state. Magnetism distorts the lattice around the central Nb atom in the star, reduces the hybridization between the central Nb d$_{z^2-r^2}$ orbital and the neighbouring Se p-states and lifts in energy the flat band becoming non-bonding. This cooperative lattice and magnetic effect amplifies the Mott gap. Single-layer 1TNbSe$_2$ is then a phonon-assisted spin-$1/2$ Magnetic Mott insulator.},

We focus on a particular, simple $\mathbb{Z}_2$-FL* state which can undergo a confinement transition to a spatially uniform superconductor which is smoothly connected to the `plain vanilla' BCS superconductor with $d$-wave pairing. Such a transition occurs by the condensation of bosonic particles carrying $+e$ charge but no spin (`chargons'). We show that modifying the dispersion of the bosonic chargons can lead to confinement transitions with charge density waves and pair density waves at the same wave-vector $\mathbf{K}$, co-existing with $d$-wave superconductivity. We also compute the evolution of the Hall number in the normal state during the transition from the plain vanilla FL* state to a Fermi liquid, and argue, following Coleman $\it{ et \, al.}$, that it exhibits a discontinuous jump near optimal doping. We note the distinction between these results and those obtained from models of the pseudogap with fermionic chargons.},

abstract = {The microscopic mechanism for Rashba-type band splitting is examined in detail. We show how an asymmetric charge distribution is formed when the local orbital angular momentum (OAM) and crystal momentum get interlocked due to surface effects. An electrostatic energy term in the Hamiltonian appears when such an OAM- and crystal-momentum-dependent asymmetric charge distribution is placed in an electric field produced by inversion-symmetry breaking. Analysis by using an effective Hamiltonian shows that, as the atomic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength increases from weak to strong, the originally OAM-quenched states evolve into well-defined chiral OAM states and then to states of total angular momentum J. In addition, the energy scale of the band splitting changes from the atomic SOC energy to electrostatic energy. To confirm the validity of the model, we study OAM and spin structures of the Au(111) system by using an effective Hamiltonian for the d-orbital case. As for the strong-SOC regime, we choose Bi2Te2Se as a prototype system. We performed circular dichroism angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments as well as first-principles calculations. We find that the effective model can explain various aspects of the spin and OAM structures of the system. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Quantum electrodynamics (resulting from the merger of quantum mechanics and relativity theory) has provided a clear understanding of phenomena ranging from particle physics to cosmology and from astrophysics to quantum chemistry. The ideas underlying quantum electrodynamics also influence the theory of condensed matter, but quantum relativistic effects are usually minute in the known experimental systems that can be described accurately by the non-relativistic Schr{{\"{o}}}dinger equation. Here we report an experimental study of a condensed-matter system (graphene, a single atomic layer of carbon) in which electron transport is essentially governed by Dirac's (relativistic) equation. The charge carriers in graphene mimic relativistic particles with zero rest mass and have an effective 'speed of light' c* approximately 10(6) m s(-1). Our study reveals a variety of unusual phenomena that are characteristic of two-dimensional Dirac fermions. In particular we have observed the following: first, graphene's conductivity never falls below a minimum value corresponding to the quantum unit of conductance, even when concentrations of charge carriers tend to zero; second, the integer quantum Hall effect in graphene is anomalous in that it occurs at half-integer filling factors; and third, the cyclotron mass m(c) of massless carriers in graphene is described by E = m(c)c*2. This two-dimensional system is not only interesting in itself but also allows access to the subtle and rich physics of quantum electrodynamics in a bench-top experiment.},

@article{Schwinger1948,
abstract = {Attempts to avoid the divergence difficulties of quantum electrodynamics by multilation of the theory have been uniformly unsuccessful. The lack of convergence does indicate that a revision of electrodynamic concepts at ultrarelativistic energies is indeed necessary, but no appreciable alteration of the theory for moderate relativistic energies can be tolerated. The elementary phenomena in which divergences occur, in consequence of virtual transitions involving particles with unlimited energy, are the polarization of the vacuum and the self-energy of the electron, effects which essentially express the interaction of the electromagnetic and matter fields with their own vacuum fluctuations. The basic result of these fluctuation interactions is to alter the constants characterizing the properties of the individual fields, and their mutual coupling, albeit by infinite factors. The question is naturally posed whether all divergences can be isolated in such unobservable renormalization factors; more specifically, we inquire whether quantum electrodynamics can account unambiguously for the recently observed deviations from the Dirac electron theory, without the introduction of fundamentally new concepts. This paper, the first in a series devoted to the above question, is occupied with the formulation of a completely covariant electrodynamics. Manifest covariance with respect to Lorentz and gauge transformations is essential in a divergent theory since the use of a particular reference system or gauge in the course of calculation can result in a loss of covariance in view of the ambiguities that may be the concomitant of infinities. It is remarked, in the first section, that the customary canonical commutation relations, which fail to exhibit the desired covariance since they refer to field variables at equal times and different points of space, can be put in covariant form by replacing the four-dimensional surface t=const. by a space-like surface. The latter is such that light signals cannot be propagated between any two points on the surface. In this manner, a formulation of quantum electrodynamics is constructed in the Heisenberg representation, which is obviously covariant in all its aspects. It is not entirely suitable, however, as a practical means of treating electrodynamic questions, since commutators of field quantities at points separated by a time-like interval can be constructed only by solving the equations of motion. This situation is to be contrasted with that of the Schr{{\"{o}}}dinger representation, in which all operators refer to the same time, thus providing a distinct separation between kinematical and dynamical aspects. A formulation that retains the evident covariance of the Heisenberg representation, and yet offers something akin to the advantage of the Schr{{\"{o}}}dinger representation can be based on the distinction between the properties of non-interacting fields, and the effects of coupling between fields. In the second section, we construct a canonical transformation that changes the field equations in the Heisenberg representation into those of non-interacting fields, and therefore describes the coupling between fields in terms of a varying state vector. It is then a simple matter to evaluate commutators of field quantities at arbitrary space-time points. One thus obtains an obviously convariant and practical form of quantum electrodynamics, expressed in a mixed Heisenberg-Schr{{\"{o}}}dinger representation, which is called the interaction representation. The third section is devoted to a discussion of the covariant elimination of the longitudinal field, in which the customary distinction between longitudinal and transverse fields is replaced by a suitable covariant definition. The fourth section is concerned with the description of collision processes in terms of an invariant collision operator, which is the unitary operator that determines the over-all change in state of a system as the result of interaction. It is shown that the collision operator is simply related to the Hermitian reaction operator, for which a variational principle is constructed.},

abstract = {The abrupt first-order metal-insulator phase transition in single-crystal vanadium dioxide nanowires (NWs) is engineered to be a gradual transition by axially grading the doping level of tungsten. We also demonstrate the potential of these NWs for thermal sensing and actuation applications. At room temperature, the graded-doped NWs show metal phase on the tips and insulator phase near the center of the NW, and the metal phase grows progressively toward the center when the temperature rises. As such, each individual NW acts as a microthermometer that can be simply read out with an optical microscope. The NW resistance decreases gradually with the temperature rise, eventually reaching 2 orders of magnitude drop, in stark contrast to the abrupt resistance change in undoped VO2 wires. This novel phase transition yields an extremely high temperature coefficient of resistivity {$\sim$}10{%}/K, simultaneously with a very low resistivity down to 0.001 $\Omega${\textperiodcentered}cm, making these NWs promising infrared sensing materials for uncooled microbolometers. Lastly, they form bimorph thermal actuators that bend with an unusually high curvature, {$\sim$}900 m(-1){\textperiodcentered}K(-1) over a wide temperature range (35-80 °C), significantly broadening the response temperature range of previous VO2 bimorph actuators. Given that the phase transition responds to a diverse range of stimuli-heat, electric current, strain, focused light, and electric field-the graded-doped NWs may find wide applications in thermo-opto-electro-mechanical sensing and energy conversion.},

The same analytic properties are shown to lead, by direct statistical mechanical arguments, to simple expressions for the low- temperature heat capacity, the spin paramagnetism, and the compressibility of the system. These expressions are very analogous to the corresponding expressions for noninteracting particles.

In contrast to the well-known hydrogen model of three-dimensional (3D) excitons, the description of 2D excitons is complicated by the fact that the screening cannot be assumed to be local. We show that one can consistently define an effective 2D dielectric constant by averaging the screening over the extend of the exciton. For an ideal 2D semiconductor this leads to a simple expression for EB that only depends on the excitonic mass and the 2D polarizability $\alpha$. The model is shown to produce accurate results for 51 transition metal dichalcogenides. Remarkably, over a wide range of polarizabilities the binding energy becomes independent of the mass and we obtain EB2D≈3/(4$\pi$$\alpha$), which explains the recently observed linear scaling of exciton binding energies with band gap. It is also shown that the model accurately reproduces the nonhydrogenic Rydberg series in WS2 and can account for screening from the environment.},

Here, we show that phonons are, in fact, sensitive to magnetic fields, even in diamagnetic materials. We do so by demonstrating experimentally that acoustic phonons in a diamagnetic semiconductor (InSb) scatter more strongly from one another when a magnetic field is applied. We attribute this observation to the magnetic-field sensitivity of the anharmonicity of the interatomic bonds that govern the probability of phonon–phonon interactions. The displacements of atoms locally affect the orbital motion of valence band electrons, which, in the presence of an external magnetic field, spatially modulates the orbital diamagnetism around the displaced atoms. The spatial gradient in magnetic moment results in an anharmonic magnetic force exerted on the displaced atom. The process is modelled by ab initio calculations that, without the use of a single adjustable parameter, reproduce the observed 12% decrease in the lattice thermal conductivity under a 7 T magnetic field at a temperature of 5.2 K.},

abstract = {The GW approximation to the formally exact many-body perturbation theory has been applied successfully to materials for several decades. Since the practical calculations are extremely cumbersome, the GW self-energy is most commonly evaluated using a first-order perturbative approach: This is the so-called G0W0 scheme. However, the G0W0 approximation depends heavily on the mean-field theory that is employed as a basis for the perturbation theory. Recently, a procedure to reach a kind of self-consistency within the GWframework has been proposed. The quasiparticle self-consistent GW (QSGW) approximation retains some positive aspects of a self-consistent approach, but circumvents the intricacies of the complete GW theory, which is inconveniently based on a non-Hermitian and dynamical self-energy. This new scheme allows one to sur- mount most of the flaws of the usual G0W0 at a moderate calculation cost and at a reasonable implementation burden. In particular, the issues of small band gap semiconductors, of large band gap insulators, and of some transition metal oxides are then cured. The QSGW method broadens the range of materials for which the spectral properties can be predicted with confidence},

abstract = {A self-consistent scheme for the calculations of the interacting ground state and the near band-gap optical spectra of mono- and multilayer transition-metal-dichalcogenide systems is presented. The approach combines a dielectric model for the Coulomb interaction potential in a multilayer environment, gap equations for the renormalized ground state, and the Dirac-Wannier equation to determine the excitonic properties. To account for the extension of the individual monolayers perpendicular to their basic plane, an effective thickness parameter in the Coulomb interaction potential is introduced. Numerical evaluations show that the resulting finite thickness effects lead to significant modifications in the optical spectra, reproducing the experimentally observed nonhydrogenic features of the excitonic resonance series. Applying the theory for a variety of experimentally relevant configurations, a consistent description of the near band-gap optical properties is obtained all the way from monolayer to bulk. In addition to the well-known in-plane excitons, also interlayer excitons occur in multilayer systems suggesting a reinterpretation of experimental results obtained for bulk material.},

When an insulator-to-metal transition is induced in a correlated insulator by doping or heating, the resulting conducting state can be radically different from that characterized by free electrons in conventional metals. We report on the electronic properties of a prototypical correlated insulator vanadium dioxide in which the metallic state can be induced by increasing temperature. Scanning near-field infrared microscopy allows us to directly image nanoscale metallic puddles that appear at the onset of the insulator-to-metal transition. In combination with far-field infrared spectroscopy, the data reveal the Mott transition with divergent quasi-particle mass in the metallic puddles. The experimental approach used sets the stage for investigations of charge dynamics on the nanoscale in other inhomogeneous correlated electron systems.},

abstract = {The optical constants of VO2 have been determined between 0.25 and 5 eV both below and above the semiconductor-metal transition temperature T&= 340 K. ReQectivity and transmission spectra have been measured on both single crystals and thin films. The reQectivity spectra of the bulk crystals were measured with EJ (c axis) in the tetragonal phase [or J (a axis) in the monoclinic phasej, and with E parallel to these axes. While there are some differences in magnitude between the dielectric constants obtained from thin-film and single-crystal measurements, the structural features are in good agreement. Below Tg there are four prominent absorption peaks centered near photon energies of 0.85, 1. 3, 2.8, and 3. 6 eV. Above Tg, metallic free-carrier absorption is observed below 2.0 eV, but the same two absorption peaks near 3 and 4 eV are present. The energy location and polarization dependence of these two higher energy peaks can be related to similar absorption peaks in rutile, and are interpreted using the rutile band structure. The results are consistent with a picture in which filled bands arising primarily from oxygen 2p orbitals are separated by approximately 2.5 eV from partially filled bands arising primarily from vanadium 3d orbitals. Transitions from the filled 2p bands are responsible for the high-energy peaks in the optical absorption in both the high- and low-temperature phases. In the high-temperature metallic phase, there is evidence that there is overlap among the 3d bands such that at least two bands are partially occupied by the extra d electron per vanadium ion. In the low-temperature semiconductor phase, a band gap of approxi- mately 0. 6 eV opens up within the 3d bands, separating two filled bands from higher-lying empty bands. The two absorption peaks at 0. 85 and 1. 3 eV are due to transitions from these two filled bands.},

Equivalent representations of a discrete connection are considered, and an extension of the pair groupoid composition, that takes into account the principal bundle structure, is introduced. Computational issues, such as the order of approximation, are also addressed. Discrete connections provide an intrinsic method for introducing coordinates on the reduced space for discrete mechanics, and provide the necessary discrete geometry to introduce more general discrete symmetry reduction. In addition, discrete analogues of the Levi-Civita connection, and its curvature, are introduced by using the machinery of discrete exterior calculus, and discrete connections.},

This suggests that the electron states in strongly anharmonic crystals, which are the phonon source terms, may be non-trivial and consist of a many-body structure which is not describable in terms of single quasiparticles.},

abstract = {Tuning the metal insulator transition (MIT) behavior of VO2 film through the interfacial strain is effective for practical applications. However, the mechanism for strain-modulated MIT is still under debate. Here we directly record the strain dynamics of ultrathin VO2 film on TiO2 substrate and reveal the intrinsic modulation process by means of synchrotron radiation and first-principles calculations. It is observed that the MIT process of the obtained VO2 films can be modulated continuously via the interfacial strain. The relationship between the phase transition temperature and the strain evolution is established from the initial film growth. From the interfacial strain dynamics and theoretical calculations, we claim that the electronic orbital occupancy is strongly affected by the interfacial strain, which changes also the electron-electron correlation and controls the phase transition temperature. These findings open the possibility of an active tuning of phase transition for the thin VO2 film through the interfacial lattice engineering.},

Going from the non-superconducting Rb$_{0.8}$Fe$_{2}$(Se$_{1-z}$S$_z$)$_2$ to superconducting Rb$_{0.8}$Fe$_{2}$Se$_2$, we observe little change of the Fermi surface topology, but a reduction of the overall bandwidth by a factor of 2 as well as an increase of the orbital-dependent renormalization in the $d_{xy}$ orbital. Hence for these heavily electron-doped iron chalcogenides, we have identified electron correlation to be the important tuning parameter for superconductivity, and that moderate correlation is essential to achieving high $T_C$.},

abstract = {The program phon calculates force constant matrices and phonon frequencies in crystals. From the frequencies it also calculates various thermodynamic quantities, like the Helmholtz free energy, the entropy, the specific heat and the internal energy of the harmonic crystal. The procedure is based on the small displacement method, and can be used in combination with any program capable to calculate forces on the atoms of the crystal. In order to examine the usability of the method, I present here two examples: metallic Al and insulating MgO. The phonons of these two materials are calculated using density functional theory. The small displacement method results are compared with those obtained using the linear response method. In the case of Al the method provides accurate phonon frequencies everywhere in the Brillouin Zone (BZ). In the case of MgO the longitudinal branch of the optical phonons near the centre of the BZ is incorrectly described as degenerate with the two transverse branches, because the non-analytical part of the dynamical matrix is ignored here; however, thermodynamic properties like the Helmholtz free are essentially unaffected.

External routines: Subprograms ZHEEV and DSYEV (Lapack); needs BLAS. A tutorial is provided with the distribution which requires the installation of the quantum-espresso package (http://www.quantum-espresso.org). Nature of problem: Stable crystals at low temperature can be well described by expanding the potential energy around the atomic equilibrium positions. The movements of the atoms around their equilibrium positions can then be described using harmonic theory, and is characterised by global vibrations called phonons, which can be identified by vectors in the Brillouin zone of the crystal, and there are 3 phonon branches for each atom in the primitive cell. The problem is to calculate the frequencies of these phonons for any arbitrary choice of q-vector in the Brillouin zone. Solution method: The small displacement method: each atom in the primitive cell is displaced by a small amount, and the forces induced on all the other atoms in the crystal are calculated and used to construct the force constant matrix. Supercells of ∼100 atoms are usually large enough to describe the force constant matrix up to the range where its elements have fallen to negligibly small values. The force constant matrix is then used to compute the dynamical matrix at any chosen q-vector in the Brillouin zone, and the diagonalisation of the dynamical matrix provides the squares of the phonon frequencies. The PHON code needs external programs to calculate these forces, and it can be used with any program capable of calculating forces in crystals. The most useful applications are obtained with codes based on density functional theory, but there is no restriction on what can be used. Running time: Negligible, typically a few seconds (or at most a few minutes) on a PC. It can take longer if very dense meshes of q-points are needed, for example, to compute very accurate phonon density of states. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Coupling between electrons and phonons (lattice vibrations) drives the formation of the electron pairs responsible for conventional superconductivity. The lack of direct evidence for electron-phonon coupling in the electron dynamics of the high-transition-temperature superconductors has driven an intensive search for an alternative mechanism. A coupling of an electron with a phonon would result in an abrupt change of its velocity and scattering rate near the phonon energy. Here we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to probe electron dynamics-velocity and scattering rate-for three different families of copper oxide superconductors. We see in all of these materials an abrupt change of electron velocity at 50-80 meV, which we cannot explain by any known process other than to invoke coupling with the phonons associated with the movement of the oxygen atoms. This suggests that electron-phonon coupling strongly influences the electron dynamics in the high-temperature superconductors, and must therefore be included in any microscopic theory of superconductivity.},

In contrast to this, Fe-doping near the surface produces both isovalent and heterovalent substitution (Fe3+ → Zn2+). The calculations performed herein suggest that the most likely defect structure is the single or double substitution of Zn with Fe, although, if additional oxygen is available, then Fe substitution with interstitial oxygen is even more energetically favorable. Furthermore, it is found that ferromagnetic states are energetically unfavorable, and ferromagnetic ordering is likely to be realized only through the formation of a secondary phase (i.e., ZnFe2O 4), or codoping with Cu. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {The electronic ground state of a periodic system is usually described in terms of extended Bloch orbitals, but an alternative representation in terms of localized "Wannier functions" was introduced by Gregory Wannier in 1937. The connection between the Bloch and Wannier representations is realized by families of transformations in a continuous space of unitary matrices, carrying a large degree of arbitrariness. Since 1997, methods have been developed that allow one to iteratively transform the extended Bloch orbitals of a first-principles calculation into a unique set of maximally localized Wannier functions, accomplishing the solid-state equivalent of constructing localized molecular orbitals, or "Boys orbitals" as previously known from the chemistry literature. These developments are reviewed here, and a survey of the applications of these methods is presented. This latter includes a description of their use in analyzing the nature of chemical bonding, or as a local probe of phenomena related to electric polarization and orbital magnetization. Wannier interpolation schemes are also reviewed, by which quantities computed on a coarse reciprocal-space mesh can be used to interpolate onto much finer meshes at low cost, and applications in which Wannier functions are used as efficient basis functions are discussed. Finally the construction and use of Wannier functions outside the context of electronic-structure theory is presented, for cases that include phonon excitations, photonic crystals, and cold-atom optical lattices. {{{\textcopyright}}} 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The particle number N fluctuates in a spherical volume fragment $\Omega$ of a uniform electron gas. In an ideal classical-gas or ” Hartree” model, the fluctuation is strong, with ($\Delta$N$\Omega$)2=N$\Omega$. We show in detail how this fluctuation is reduced by exchange in the ideal Fermi gas and further reduced by Coulomb correlation in the interacting Fermi gas. Besides the mean particle number N$\Omega$ and mean square fluctuation ($\Delta$N$\Omega$)2=(N2)$\Omega$−(N$\Omega$)2, we also examine the full probability distribution P$\Omega$(N). The latter is approximately Gaussian, and exactly Gaussian for $\$documentclassarticle$\$pagestyleempty$\$begindocument{$}N{_}{{\O}}mega\backslashgg1{$}$\$enddocument. More precisely, for any N$\Omega$ it is a Poisson distribution for the ideal classical gas and a modified Poisson distribution for the ideal or interacting Fermi gases. While most of our results are for nonzero densities and three dimensions, we also consider fluctuations in the low-density or strictly correlated limit and in the electron gas of one or two dimensions. In one dimension, the electrons may be strictly correlated at all finite densities. Fulde's fluctuation-based index of correlation strength applies to the uniform gas in any number of dimensions. $\$copyright 2000 John Wiley {&} Sons, Inc. Int J Quant Chem 77: 819–830, 2000},

abstract = {Recently, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has been used to highlight an anomalously large band renormalization at high binding energies in cuprate superconductors: the high energy 'waterfall' or high energy anomaly (HEA). This paper demonstrates, using a combination of new ARPES measurements and quantum Monte Carlo simulations, that the HEA is not simply the by-product of matrix element effects, but rather represents a cross-over from a quasiparticle band at low binding energies near the Fermi level to valence bands at higher binding energy, assumed to be of strong oxygen character, in both hole- and electron-doped cuprates. While photoemission matrix elements clearly play a role in changing the aesthetic appearance of the band dispersion, i.e. the 'waterfall'-like behavior, they provide an inadequate description for the physics that underlies the strong band renormalization giving rise to the HEA. Model calculations of the single-band Hubbard Hamiltonian showcase the role played by correlations in the formation of the HEA and uncover significant differences in the HEA energy scale for hole- and electron-doped cuprates. In addition, this approach properly captures the transfer of spectral weight accompanying both hole and electron doping in a correlated material and provides a unifying description of the HEA across both sides of the cuprate phase diagram.},

abstract = {The Role of Bilateral ECT When Right Unilateral ECT Is Inferior TO THE EDITOR: We read with great interest the important results of the trial by Semkovska et al., published in the April 2016 issue of the Journal (1), regarding bitemporal versus high-dose unilateral ECT for depression. While the findings add to the evidence base of the efficacy of right unilateral electrode placement and demonstrate " noninferiority " at the group data level, we should be careful not to dismiss the clinical importance of bilateral electrode placement (2). As noted by the authors, response and remission rates were quite low for both interventions in this study. At the individual patient level, it is likely that a substantial proportion of the 54% of nonremitters in the right unilateral group would have gone on to reach remission had they been crossed over to bilateral placement. In clinical practice, many patients who elect to start ECT with right unilateral placement and who show inadequate response after 1–2 weeks of treatment are switched to bilateral placement with, ultimately, excellent results (3). ECT is a treatment often prescribed for our most severely ill patients, some with life-threatening illness; effi-cacy should not be compromised for fear of transient cog-nitive tolerability issues. Right unilateral ECT, both in the form administered in the study by Semkovska et al. and with ultrabrief stimulus waveforms, offers a welcome option for well-tolerated ECT (4). However, for the subset of patients who do not respond to it, right unilateral ECT may actually be inferior. REFERENCES 1.

abstract = {The well-known “band-gap” problem in approximate density functionals is manifested mainly in an overly low energy of the conduction band (CB). As a consequence, the localized gap states of 3d impurities states in wide-gap oxides such as ZnO occur often incorrectly as resonances inside the CB, leading to a spurious transfer of electrons from the impurity state into the CB of the host, and to a physically misleading description of the magnetic 3d-3d interactions. A correct description requires that the magnetic coupling of the impurity pairs be self-consistently determined in the presence of a correctly positioned CB (with respect to the 3d states), which we achieve here through the addition of empirical nonlocal external potentials to the standard density functional Hamiltonian. After this correction, both Co and Cr form occupied localized states in the gap and empty resonances low inside the CB. In otherwise undoped ZnO, Co and Cr remain paramagnetic, but electron-doping instigates strong ferromagnetic coupling when the resonant states become partially occupied.},

abstract = {Despite the relatively simple stoichiometry and structure of VO(2), many questions regarding the nature of its famous metal-insulator transition (MIT) remain unresolved. This is in part due to the prevailing use of polycrystalline film samples and the limited spatial resolution in most studies, hindering access to and control of the complex phase behavior and its inevitable spatial inhomogeneities. Here, we investigate the MIT and associated nanodomain formation in individual VO(2) microcrystals subject to substrate stress. We employ symmetry-selective polarization Raman spectroscopy to identify crystals that are strain-stabilized in either the monoclinic M1 or M2 insulating phase at room-temperature. Raman measurements are further used to characterize the phase dependence on temperature, identifying the appearance of the M2 phase during the MIT. The associated formation and spatial evolution of rutile (R) metallic domains is studied with nanometer-scale spatial resolution using infrared scattering-scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM). We deduce that even for small crystals of VO(2), the MIT is influenced by the competition between the R, M1, and M2 crystal phases with their different lattice constants subjected to the external substrate-induced stress. The results have important implications for the interpretation of the investigations of conventional polycrystalline thin films where the mutual interaction of constituent crystallites may affect the nature of the MIT in VO(2).},

abstract = {Phonons are displacements of atoms around their rest positions in a crystalline solid. They carry sound and heat, but are not classically associated with magnetism. Here, we show that phonons are, in fact, sensitive to magnetic fields, even in diamagnetic materials. We do so by demonstrating experimentally that acoustic phonons in a diamagnetic semiconductor (InSb) scatter more strongly from one another when a magnetic field is applied. We attribute this observation to the magnetic-field sensitivity of the anharmonicity of the interatomic bonds that govern the probability of phonon–phonon interactions. The displacements of atoms locally affect the orbital motion of valence band electrons, which, in the presence of an external magnetic field, spatially modulates the orbital diamagnetism around the displaced atoms. The spatial gradient in magnetic moment results in an anharmonic magnetic force exerted on the displaced atom. The process is modelled by ab initio calculations that, without the use of a single adjustable parameter, reproduce the observed 12% decrease in the lattice thermal conductivity under a 7 T magnetic field at a temperature of 5.2 K.},

abstract = {A unified development of the subject of quantum electrodynamics is outlined, embodying the main features both of the Tomonaga-Schwinger and of the Feynman radiation theory. The theory is carried to a point further than that reached by these authors, in the discussion of higher order radiative reactions and vacuum polarization phenomena. However, the theory of these higher order processes is a program rather than a definitive theory, since no general proof of the convergence of these effects is attempted.The chief results obtained are (a) a demonstration of the equivalence of the Feynman and Schwinger theories, and (b) a considerable simplification of the procedure involved in applying the Schwinger theory to particular problems, the simplification being the greater the more complicated the problem.},

abstract = {A phonon often is described as ‘‘a quantum of lattice vibration,'' but this description can be difficult to reconcile with the wave functions explored in a typical undergraduate quantum mechanics class. A phonon wave function is similar to the harmonic oscillator wave functions studied in introductory quantum mechanics, except that it is many-dimensional. We suggest a way to visualize the probability density for this very high-dimensional wave function. The resulting pictures are especially clear and intuitive for a coherent state, which is both a good approximation to a sound wave and a discrete analog to laser light. These pictures can also provide a qualitative introduction to quantum field theory.},

abstract = {Results of first-principles augmented spherical-wave electronic-structure calculations for niobium dioxide are presented. Both metallic rutile and insulating low-temperature NbO2, which crystallizes in a distorted rutile structure, are correctly described within density functional theory and the local density approximation. Metallic conductivity is carried by metal t2g orbitals, which fall into the one-dimensional d|| band and the isotropically dispersing e{^}{{}$\pi${}}{_}{{}g{}} bands. Hybridization of both types of bands is almost negligible outside narrow rods along the line X-R. In the low-temperature phase splitting of the d|| band due to metal-metal dimerization as well as upshift of the e{^}{{}$\pi${}}{_}{{}g{}} bands due to increased p-d overlap remove the Fermi surface and open an optical band gap of about 0.1 eV. The metal-insulator transition arises as a Peierls instability of the d|| band in an embedding background of e{^}{{}$\pi${}}{^}{{}g{}} electrons. This basic mechanism should also apply to VO2, where, however, electronic correlations are expected to play a greater role due to stronger localization of the 3d electrons.},

abstract = {Hybrid perovskites have emerged over the past five years as absorber layers for novel high-efficiency low-cost solar cells combining the advantages of organic and inorganic semiconductors. Unfortunately, electrical transport in these materials is still poorly understood. Employing the linear response approach of density functional theory, we reveal strong anharmonic effects and a double-well phonon instability at the center of the Brillouin zone for both cubic and orthorhombic phases of inorganic CsPbI3. Previously reported soft phonon modes are stabilized at the actual lower-symmetry equilibrium structure, which occurs in a very flat energy landscape, highlighting the strong competition between the different phases of CsPbI3. Factoring these low-energy phonons into electron-phonon interactions and band gap calculations could help better understand the electrical transport properties in these materials. Furthermore, the perovskite oscillations through the corresponding energy barrier could explain the underlying ferroelectricity and the dynamical Rashba effect predicted in halide perovskites for photovoltaics.},

abstract = {It is commonly accepted that the GW approximation for the electron self-energy is successful for the description of the band structure of weakly to moderately correlated systems, whereas it will fail for strongly correlated materials. In the present work, we discuss two important aspects of this approximation: first, the "self-screening error," which is due to an incorrect treatment of induced exchange, and second, the atomic limit, in which, instead, correlation is directly responsible for the observed problem. Using the example of the removal of a particle from a box, we show that the self-screening error stems from the use of test charge-test charge screening and that it can be corrected by a two-point vertex contribution to the self-energy derived from time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). We explain why the addition of a particle, instead, requires the use of a different approximate vertex. This illustrates why the general vertex function, valid both for valence and conduction states, must be a three-point function. Moreover, we show that also the bad performance of GW in the atomic limit is due to the neglect of the vertex in the self-energy; in that case, the TDDFT-derived vertex correction is not sufficient in order to remove the error even qualitatively. We discuss the effects of the self-screening error as well as the atomic limit using GW for the exactly solvable two-site Hubbard model.},

@article{Penrose1973,
abstract = {Twistor theory offers a new approach, starting with conformally-invariant concepts, to the synthesis of quantum theory and relativity. Twistors for flat space-time are the SU(2,2) spinors of the twofold covering group O(2,4) of the conformal group. They describe the momentum and angular momentum structre of zero-rest-mass particles. Space-time points arise as secondary concepts corresponding to linear sets in twistor space. They, rather than the null cones, should become “smeared out” on passage to a quantised gravitational theory. Twistors are represented here in two-component spinor terms. Zero-rest-mass fields are described by holomorphic functions on twistor space, on which there is a natural canonical structure leading to a natural choice of canonical quantum operators. The generalisation to curved space can be accomplished in three ways; i) local twistors, a conformally invariant calculus, ii) global twistors, and iii) asymptotic twistors which provide the framework for an S-matrix approach in asymptotically flat space-times. A Hamiltonian scattering theory of global twistors is used to calculate scattering cross-sections. This leads to twistor analogues of Feynman graphs for the treatment of massless quantum electrodynamics. The recent development of methods for dealing with massive (conformal symmetry breaking) sources and fields is briefly reviewed.},

abstract = {First-order phase transitions in solids are notoriously challenging to study. The combination of change in unit cell shape, long range of elastic distortion and flow of latent heat leads to large energy barriers resulting in domain structure, hysteresis and cracking. The situation is worse near a triple point, where more than two phases are involved. The well-known metal-insulator transition in vanadium dioxide, a popular candidate for ultrafast optical and electrical switching applications, is a case in point. Even though VO2 is one of the simplest strongly correlated materials, experimental difficulties posed by the first-order nature of the metal-insulator transition as well as the involvement of at least two competing insulating phases have led to persistent controversy about its nature. Here we show that studying single-crystal VO2 nanobeams in a purpose-built nanomechanical strain apparatus allows investigation of this prototypical phase transition with unprecedented control and precision. Our results include the striking finding that the triple point of the metallic phase and two insulating phases is at the transition temperature, Ttr = Tc, which we determine to be 65.0 ± 0.1 °C. The findings have profound implications for the mechanism of the metal-insulator transition in VO2, but they also demonstrate the importance of this approach for mastering phase transitions in many other strongly correlated materials, such as manganites and iron-based superconductors.},

@article{Lee2007,
abstract = {This review gives a rather general discussion of high temperature superconductors as an example of a strongly correlated material. The argument is made that in view of the many examples of unconventional superconductors discovered in the past twenty years, we should no longer be surprised that superconductivity emerges as a highly competitive ground state in systems where Coulomb repulsion plays a dominant role. The physics of the cuprates is discussed, emphasizing the unusual pseudogap phase in the underdoped region. It is argued that the resonating valence bond (RVB) picture, as formulated using gauge theory with fermionic and bosonic matter fields, gives an adequate physical understanding, even though many details are beyond the powers of current calculational tools. The recent discovery of quantum oscillations in a high magnetic field is discussed in this context. Meanwhile, the problem of the quantum spin liquid (a spin system with antiferromagnetic coupling which refuses to order even at zero temperature) is a somewhat simpler version of the high $T_c$ problem where significant progress has been made recently. It is understood that the existence of matter fields can lead to de-confinement of the U(1) gauge theory in 2+1 dimensions, and novel new particles (called fractionalized particles), such as fermionic spinons which carry spin ${1\over 2}$ and no charge, and gapless gauge bosons can emerge to create a new critical state at low energies. We even have a couple of real materials where such a scenario may be realized experimentally. The article ends with answers to questions such as: what limits $T_c$ if pairing is driven by an electronic energy scale? why is the high $T_c$ problem hard? why is there no consensus? and why is the high $T_c$ problem important?},

abstract = {We report on a photoinduced transient state of YBa2Cu2O6+{\^{I}} in which transport perpendicular to the Cu-O planes becomes highly coherent. This effect is achieved by excitation with mid-infrared optical pulses, tuned to the resonant frequency of apical oxygen vibrations, which modulate both lattice and electronic properties. Below the superconducting transition temperature Tc, the equilibrium signatures of superconducting interlayer coupling are enhanced. Most strikingly, the optical excitation induces a new reflectivity edge at higher frequency than the equilibrium Josephson plasma resonance, with a concomitant enhancement of the low-frequency imaginary conductivity {\"{I}}2({\"{I}}‰). Above Tc, the incoherent equilibrium conductivity becomes highly coherent, with the appearance of a reflectivity edge and a positive {\"{I}}2({\"{I}}‰) that increases with decreasing frequency. These features are observed up to room temperature in YBa2Cu2O6.45 and YBa2Cu2O6.5. The data above Tc can be fitted by hypothesizing that the light establishes a transient superconducting state over only a fraction of the solid, with a lifetime of a few picoseconds. Non-superconducting transport could also explain these observations, although one would have to assume transient carrier mobilities near 104 cm2/V sec at 100 K, with a density of charge carriers similar to the below-Tc superfluid density. Our results are indicative of highly unconventional nonequilibrium physics and open new prospects for optical control of complex solids. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {It is shown that certain analytical properties of the propagators of many-fermion systems lead rigorously to the existence of sharp discontinuities of the momentum distribution at absolute zero. This discontinuity in the momentum distribution is used to define a Fermi surface for a system of interacting fermions. It is shown that the volume of this surface in momentum space is unaffected by the interaction. The same analytic properties are shown to lead, by direct statistical mechanical arguments, to simple expressions for the low- temperature heat capacity, the spin paramagnetism, and the compressibility of the system. These expressions are very analogous to the corresponding expressions for noninteracting particles. Finally, it is shown how the whole formalism may be generalized when an external periodic potential is present (band case).},

abstract = {Slow electron-hole recombination, characterized by the bimolecular coefficient k2 in hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs), is a key to their outstanding photovoltaic performance. The measured k2 in HOIPs strongly deviates from k2 ∞ T-3/2 (T is the temperature) in typical direct-gap semiconductors. Here we show that the observed temperature dependence can be quantitatively accounted for by phonon-assisted recombination of electrons and holes located at the band extrema, which become indirect due to the Rashba effect. Polar optical phonons are most effective in facilitating this indirect recombination. The variation in k2 in HOIPs among different studies in the literature can be attributed to different Rashba strengths in their samples. Our results indicate that the confluence of the Rashba effect and polar coupling transform HOIPs into a unique indirect semiconductor that can accommodate both strong optical absorption and slow carrier dynamics.},

@article{Jaynes1963,
abstract = { This paper has two purposes: 1) to clarify the relationship between the quantum theory of radiation, where the electromagnetic field-expansion coefficients satisfy commutation relations, and the semiclassical theory, where the electromagnetic field is considered as a definite function of time rather than as an operator; and 2) to apply some of the results in a study of amplitude and frequency stability in a molecular beam maser. In 1), it is shown that the semiclassical theory, when extended te take into account both the effect of the field on the molecules and the effect of the molecules on the field, reproduces almost quantitatively the same laws of energy exchange and coherence properties as the quantized field theory, even in the limit of one or a few quanta in the field mode. In particular, the semiclassical theory is shown to lead to a prediction of spontaneous emission, with the same decay rate as given by quantum electrodynamics, described by the Einstein A coefficients. In 2), the semiclassical theory is applied to the molecular beam maser. Equilibrium amplitude and frequency of oscillation are obtained for an arbitrary velocity distribution of focused molecules, generalizing the results obtained previously by Gordon, Zeiger, and Townes for a singel-velocity beam, and by Lamb and Helmer for a Maxwellian beam. A somewhat surprising result is obtained; which is that the measurable properties of the maser, such as starting current, effective molecular Q, etc., depend mostly on the slowest 5 to 10 per cent of the molecules. Next we calculate the effect of amplitude and frequency of oscillation, of small systematic perturbations. We obtain a prediction that stability can be improved by adjusting the system so that the molecules emit all their energy h &#937; to the field, then reabsorb part of it, before leaving the cavity. In general, the most stable operation is obtained when the molecules are in the process of absorbing energy from the radiation as they leave the cavity, most unstable when they are still emitting energy at that time. Finally, we consider the response of an oscillating maser to randomly time-varying perturbations. Graphs are given showing predicted response to a small superimposed signal of a frequency near the -\noscillation frequency. The existence of "noise enhancing" and "noise quieting" modes of operation found here is a general property of any oscillating system in which amplitude is limited by nonlinearity.},

abstract = {Causal set theory provides a model of discrete spacetime in which spacetime events are represented by elements of a causal set---a locally finite, partially ordered set in which the partial order represents the causal relationships between events. The work presented here describes a model for matter on a causal set, specifically a theory of quantum scalar fields on a causal set spacetime background. The work starts with a discrete path integral model for particles on a causal set. Here quantum mechanical amplitudes are assigned to trajectories within the causal set. By summing these over all trajectories between two spacetime events we obtain a causal set particle propagator. With a suitable choice of amplitudes this is shown to agree (in an appropriate sense) with the retarded propagator for the Klein-Gordon equation in Minkowski spacetime. This causal set propagator is then used to define a causal set analogue of the Pauli-Jordan function that appears in continuum quantum field theories. A quantum scalar field is then modelled by an algebra of operators which satisfy three simple conditions (including a bosonic commutation rule). Defining time-ordering through a linear extension of the causal set these field operators are used to define a causal set Feynman propagator. Evidence is presented which shows agreement (in a suitable sense) between the causal set Feynman propagator and the continuum Feynman propagator for the Klein-Gordon equation in Minkowski spacetime. The Feynman propagator is obtained using the eigendecomposition of the Pauli-Jordan function, a method which can also be applied in continuum-based theories. The free field theory is extended to include interacting scalar fields. This leads to a suggestion for a non-perturbative S-matrix on a causal set. Models for continuum-based phenomenology and spin-half particles on a causal set are also presented.},

Going from the non-superconducting Rb$_{0.8}$Fe$_{2}$(Se$_{1-z}$S$_z$)$_2$ to superconducting Rb$_{0.8}$Fe$_{2}$Se$_2$, we observe little change of the Fermi surface topology, but a reduction of the overall bandwidth by a factor of 2 as well as an increase of the orbital-dependent renormalization in the $d_{xy}$ orbital. Hence for these heavily electron-doped iron chalcogenides, we have identified electron correlation to be the important tuning parameter for superconductivity, and that moderate correlation is essential to achieving high $T_C$.},

@article{SCHWINGER1949,
abstract = {The covariant formulation of quantum electrodynamics, developed in a previous paper, is here applied to two elementary problems—the polarization of the vacuum and the self-energies of the electron and photon. In the first section the vacuum of the non-interacting electromagnetic and matter fields is covariantly defined as that state for which the eigenvalue of an arbitrary time-like component of the energy-momentum four-vector is an absolute minimum. It is remarked that this definition must be compatible with the requirement that the vacuum expectation values of a physical quantity in various coordinate systems should be, not only covariantly related, but identical, since the vacuum has a significance that is independent of the coordinate system. In order to construct a suitable characterization of the vacuum state vector, a covariant decomposition of the field operators into positive and negative frequency components is introduced, and the properties of these associated fields developed. It is shown that the state vector for the electromagnetic vacuum is annihilated by the positive frequency part of the transverse four-vector potential, while that for the matter vacuum is annihilated by the positive frequency part of the Dirac spinor and of its charge conjugate. These defining properties of the vacuum state vector are employed in the calculation of the vacuum expectation values of quadratic field quantities, specifically the energy-momentum tensors of the independent electromagnetic and matter fields, and the current four-vector. It is inferred that the electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor, and the current vector must vanish in the vacuum, while the matter field energy-momentum tensor vanishes in the vacuum only by the addition of a suitable multiple of the unit tensor. The second section treats the induction of a current in the vacuum by an external electromagnetic field. It is supposed that the latter does not produce actual electron-positron pairs; that is, we consider only the phenomenon of virtual pair creation. This restriction is introduced by requiring that the establishment and subsequent removal of the external field produce no net change in state for the matter field. It is demonstrated, in a general manner, that the induced current at a given space-time point involves the external current in the vicinity of that point, and not the electromagnetic potentials. This gauge invariant result shows that a light wave, propagating at remote distances from its source, induces no current in the vacuum and is therefore undisturbed in its passage through space. The absence of a light quantum self-energy effect is thus indicated. The current induced at a point consists, more precisely, of two parts: a logarithmically divergent multiple of the external current at that point, which produces an unobservable renormalization of charge, and a more involved finite contribution, which is the physically significant induced current. The latter agrees with the results of previous investigations. The modification of the matter field properties arising from interaction with the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field is considered in the third section. The analysis is carried out with two alternative formulations, one employing the complete electromagnetic potential together with a supplementary condition, the other using the transverse potential, with the variables of the supplementary condition eliminated. It is noted that no real processes are produced by the first order coupling between the fields. Accordingly, alternative equations of motion for the state vector are constructed, from which the first order interaction term has been eliminated and replaced by the second order coupling which it generates. The latter includes the self action of individual particles and light quanta, the interaction of different particles, and a coupling between particles and light quanta which produces such effects as Compton scattering and two quantum pair annihilation. It is concluded from a comparison of the alternative procedures that, for the treatment of virtual light quantum processes, the separate consideration of longitudinal and transverse fields is an inadvisable complication. The light quantum self-energy term is shown to vanish, while that for a particle has the anticipated form for a change in proper mass, although the latter is logarithmically divergent, in agreement with previous calculations. To confirm the identification of the self-energy effect with a change in proper mass, it is shown that the result of removing this term from the state vector equation of motion is to alter the matter field equations of motion in the expected manner. It is verified, finally, that the energy and momentum modifications produced by self-interaction effects are entirely accounted for by the addition of the electromagnetic proper mass to the mechanical proper mass—an unobservable mass renormalization. An appendix is devoted to the construction of several invariant functions associated with the electromagnetic and matter fields.},

These range from early work on stripe correlations in Nd-LSCO to the latest discovery of charge-density-waves in YBa2Cu3O(6+x). Both phenomena are characterized by a pronounced dependence on doping, temperature and an externally applied magnetic field. Here, we show that these electron-lattice instabilities exhibit also a previously unrecognized bulk-surface dichotomy. Surface-sensitive electronic and structural probes uncover a temperature-dependent evolution of the CuO2 plane band dispersion and apparent Fermi pockets in underdoped Bi2 Sr(2-x) La(x) CuO(6+$\delta$) (Bi2201), which is directly associated with an hitherto-undetected strong temperature dependence of the incommensurate superstructure periodicity below 130 K. In stark contrast, the structural modulation revealed by bulk-sensitive probes is temperature-independent. These findings point to a surface-enhanced incipient charge-density-wave instability, driven by Fermi surface nesting. This discovery is of critical importance in the interpretation of single-particle spectroscopy data, and establishes the surface of cuprates and other complex oxides as a rich playground for the study of electronically soft phases.},

abstract = {Recently, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has been used to highlight an anomalously large band renormalization at high binding energies in cuprate superconductors: the high energy 'waterfall' or high energy anomaly (HEA). This paper demonstrates, using a combination of new ARPES measurements and quantum Monte Carlo simulations, that the HEA is not simply the by-product of matrix element effects, but rather represents a cross-over from a quasiparticle band at low binding energies near the Fermi level to valence bands at higher binding energy, assumed to be of strong oxygen character, in both hole- and electron-doped cuprates. While photoemission matrix elements clearly play a role in changing the aesthetic appearance of the band dispersion, i.e. the 'waterfall'-like behavior, they provide an inadequate description for the physics that underlies the strong band renormalization giving rise to the HEA. Model calculations of the single-band Hubbard Hamiltonian showcase the role played by correlations in the formation of the HEA and uncover significant differences in the HEA energy scale for hole- and electron-doped cuprates. In addition, this approach properly captures the transfer of spectral weight accompanying both hole and electron doping in a correlated material and provides a unifying description of the HEA across both sides of the cuprate phase diagram.},

Born's translation and rotation invariance conditions are shown to be satisfied by the microscopic force constants. In the case of a perfect crystal, it is shown for the first time that the microscopic formulas recapture completely the phenomenological form of the dynamical matrix; in particular, the microscopic expression for the effective charge in an insulator is found. We prove that the charge neutrality of the system implies the "effective charge neutrality" condition and that, consequently, all acoustic-mode frequencies vanish at long wavelength. This condition may be stated as a useful property of $\epsilon$−1 which we term the acoustic sum rule. Many results of the phenomenological theory, e.g., the generalized Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation, carry over exactly to the microscopic theory.},

@article{Jackson2001,
abstract = {Gauge invariance is the basis of the modern theory of electroweak and strong interactions (the so called Standard Model). The roots of gauge invariance go back to the year 1820 when electromagnetism was discovered and the first electrodynamic theory was proposed. Subsequent developments led to the discovery that different forms of the vector potential result in the same observable forces. The partial arbitrariness of the vector potential A brought forth various restrictions on it. div A = 0 was proposed by J. C. Maxwell; 4-div A = 0 was proposed L. V. Lorenz in the middle of 1860's . In most of the modern texts the latter condition is attributed to H. A. Lorentz, who half a century later was one of the key figures in the final formulation of classical electrodynamics. In 1926 a relativistic quantum-mechanical equation for charged spinless particles was formulated by E. Schrodinger, O. Klein, and V. Fock. The latter discovered that this equation is invariant with respect to multiplication of the wave function by a phase factor exp(ieX/hc) with the accompanying additions to the scalar potential of -dX/cdt and to the vector potential of grad X. In 1929 H. Weyl proclaimed this invariance as a general principle and called it Eichinvarianz in German and gauge invariance in English. The present era of non-abelian gauge theories started in 1954 with the paper by C. N. Yang and R. L. Mills.},

abstract = {The role of electron-electron interactions in determining the electron-phonon interaction in metals is investigated by extending the Bohm-Pines collective description to take into account the ionic motion. Collective coordinates are introduced to describe the long-range electron-ionic correlations, and it is shown by a series of canonical transformations that these give rise to plasma waves and to coupled electron-ion waves which correspond to longitudinal sound waves. The dispersion relation for the sound waves is identical with that derived by Toya and Nakajima by self-consistent field methods. The velocity of these sound waves is calculated from first principles for sodium and is found to be in good agreement with experiment. The effective matrix element for the electron-phonon interaction is determined and is found to be identical for long wavelengths with that found earlier by Bardeen using a self-consistent field method which neglects exchange and correlation effects. The agreement with the earlier work is explained by the fact that the residual electron-electron interaction is of quite short range, so that an independent-particle treatment is rather well justified. The effects of Coulomb correlations on superconductivity are likewise shown to be small, so that the neglect of Coulomb interactions in the formulation of the superconductivity problem is justified.},

abstract = {Superconductivity in cuprates peaks in the doping regime between a metal at high p and an insulator at low p. Understanding how the material evolves from metal to insulator is a fundamental and open question. Early studies in high magnetic fields revealed that below some critical doping an insulator-like upturn appears in the resistivity of cuprates at low temperature, but its origin has remained a puzzle. Here we propose that this 'metal-to-insulator crossover' is due to a drop in carrier density n associated with the onset of the pseudogap phase at a critical doping p*. We use high-field resistivity measurements on LSCO to show that the upturns are quantitatively consistent with a drop from n=1+p above p* to n=p below p*, in agreement with high-field Hall data in YBCO. We demonstrate how previously reported upturns in the resistivity of LSCO, YBCO and Nd-LSCO are explained by the same universal mechanism: a drop in carrier density by 1.0 hole per Cu atom.},

abstract = {Organometal halide perovskites are promising solar-cell materials for next-generation photovoltaic applications. The long carrier lifetime and diffusion length of these materials make them very attractive for use in light absorbers and carrier transporters. While these aspects of organometal halide perovskites have attracted the most attention, the consequences of the Rashba effect, driven by strong spin-orbit coupling, on the photovoltaic properties of these materials are largely unexplored. In this work, taking the electronic structure of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 (methylammonium lead iodide) as an example, we propose an intrinsic mechanism for enhanced carrier lifetime in three-dimensional (3D) Rashba materials. On the basis of first-principles calculations and a Rashba spin-orbit model, we demonstrate that the recombination rate is reduced due to the spin-forbidden transition. These results are important for understanding the fundamental physics of organometal halide perovskites and for optimizing and designing the materials with better performance. The proposed mechanism including spin degrees of freedom offers a new paradigm of using 3D Rashba materials for photovoltaic applications.},

abstract = {Although the existence of nematic order in iron-based superconductors is now a well-established experimental fact, its origin remains controversial. Nematic order breaks the discrete lattice rotational symmetry by making the x and y directions in the iron plane non-equivalent. This can happen because of a regular structural transition or as the result of an electronically driven instability [mdash] in particular, orbital order or spin-driven Ising-nematic order. The latter is a magnetic state that breaks rotational symmetry but preserves time-reversal symmetry. Symmetry dictates that the development of one of these orders immediately induces the other two, making the origin of nematicity a physics realization of the /`chicken and egg problem[rsquor]. In this Review, we argue that the evidence strongly points to an electronic mechanism of nematicity, placing nematic order in the class of correlation-driven electronic instabilities, like superconductivity and density-wave transitions. We discuss different microscopic models for nematicity and link them to the properties of the magnetic and superconducting states, providing a unified perspective on the phase diagram of the iron pnictides.},

The linearized Eliashberg equation is solved by expanding the effective pairing interaction perturbatively up to third order in the on-site Coulomb integrals. The numerical results for the 5-band model suggest that the eigenvalues of the Eliashberg equation are sufficiently large to explain the actual high Tc for realistic values of Coulomb interaction and the most probable pairing state is spin-singlet s-wave without any nodes just on the Fermi surfaces, although the superconducting order parameter changes its sign between the small Fermi pockets. On the other hand the 2-band model is quite insufficient to explain the actual high Tc.},

abstract = {Electronic nematicity, a unidirectional self-organized state that breaks the rotational symmetry of the underlying lattice, has been observed in the iron pnictide and copper oxide high-temperature superconductors. Whether nematicity plays an equally important role in these two systems is highly controversial. In iron pnictides, the nematicity has usually been associated with the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural transition at temperature T(s). Although recent experiments have provided hints of nematicity, they were performed either in the low-temperature orthorhombic phase or in the tetragonal phase under uniaxial strain, both of which break the 90° rotational C(4) symmetry. Therefore, the question remains open whether the nematicity can exist above T(s) without an external driving force. Here we report magnetic torque measurements of the isovalent-doping system BaFe(2)(As(1-x)P(x))(2), showing that the nematicity develops well above T(s) and, moreover, persists to the non-magnetic superconducting regime, resulting in a phase diagram similar to the pseudogap phase diagram of the copper oxides. By combining these results with synchrotron X-ray measurements, we identify two distinct temperatures-one at T*, signifying a true nematic transition, and the other at T(s) (<T*), which we show not to be a true phase transition, but rather what we refer to as a 'meta-nematic transition', in analogy to the well-known meta-magnetic transition in the theory of magnetism.},

abstract = {In the framework of effective mass and single-band approximations, a variational method combined with a self-consistent procedure is adopted to discuss the binding energies of heavy-hole excitons in a strained wurtzite GaN/Al0.3Ga0.7N quantum well by considering the hydrostatic pressure effect and screening due to the electron-hole gas. The built-in electric field in such a structure produced by spontaneous polarization and strain-induced piezoelectric polarization is considered in our calculation. A simplified coherent potential approximation is extended to calculate the energy gaps of the ternary mixed crystal AlxGa1-xN. The result indicates that the binding energies of excitons increase nearly linearly with pressure even when taking into consideration the modification of strain. It is also found that the percentage increase of the binding energy with pressure is influenced by the electron-hole density due to the influence of pressure on the screening and exclusion effects. The excitonic binding energies increase obviously with decreasing barrier thickness due to the built-in electric field. {\textcopyright} IOP Publishing Ltd.},

@article{Sachdev2016,
abstract = {This article is based on a talk by S.S. at the Nambu Memorial Symposium at the University of Chicago. We review ideas on the nature of the metallic states of the hole-doped cuprate high temperature superconductors, with an emphasis on the connections between the Luttinger theorem for the size of the Fermi surface, topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), and critical theories involving changes in the size of the Fermi surface. We begin with the derivation of the Luttinger theorem for a Fermi liquid, using momentum balance during a process of flux-insertion in a lattice electronic model with toroidal boundary conditions. We then review the TQFT of the Z2 spin liquid, and demonstrate its compatibility with the toroidal momentum balance argument. This discussion leads naturally to a simple construction of `topological' Fermi liquid states: the fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) and the algebraic charge liquid (ACL). We present arguments for a description of the pseudogap metal of the cuprates using Z2-FL* or Z2-ACL states with Ising-nematic order. These pseudogap metal states are also described as Higgs phases of a SU(2) gauge theory. The Higgs field represents local antiferromagnetism, but the Higgs-condensed phase does not have long-range antiferromagnetic order: the magnitude of the Higgs field determines the pseudogap, the reconstruction of the Fermi surface, and the Ising-nematic order. Finally, we discuss the route to the large Fermi surface Fermi liquid via the critical point where the Higgs condensate and Ising nematic order vanish, and the application of Higgs criticality to the strange metal.},

abstract = {Vacuum-ultraviolet reflectance and photoemission spectra of VO2, V2O3, V6O13, and V2O5 are measured in order to investigate the 3d-band structures and electron-correlation effects. In the case of VO2, drastic changes in the 3d (pi* and d||) band structures are found in both spectra through the metal-insulator phase transition. The pi* and d|| bands are found at the Fermi level and Eb=1.3 eV in the photoemission spectra of metallic VO2. In the insulating phase, the pi* valence band in the photoemission spectra becomes empty and a rise of the pi* conduction band by about 0.5 eV is found in the reflectance spectra. This band shift through the phase transition may be a driving force of the metal-insulator transition of VO2. The optical band gap between the d|| valence and pi* conduction bands is obtained as 0.7 eV in the insulating phase, to which the pi*-d|| correlation energy contributes partially. The splitting of the d|| band is also found in the insulating phase. This splitting energy is about 2.5 eV, while the bandwidth of the d|| band is about 1.5 eV. This large band splitting is mainly due to the correlation energy of d|| electrons of about U(d||, d||)=2.1 eV. On the other hand, no drastic change is found in the 3d-band structures of V6O13 and V2O3 except for slight changes in the bandwidths. Furthermore, the density of states at the Fermi level is rather low in these materials even in the metallic phase. These facts support the view that the electron-correlation effects are important and Mott-type metal-insulator transitions are induced in V6O13 and V2O3. Resonant photoemission from V3d and O2p bands are observed as the photon energy is swept through the 3p->3d optical-absorption transition. The resonance profiles of V3d bands show the characteristic antiresonance dip, while those of O2p bands show rather broad and simple enhancements. The multiplet structures in the 3p core photoemission spectra of VO2 and V203 are quantitatively analyzed with use of results from the calculations of Yamaguchi et al.},

Recent progress in our understanding of compressible quantum phases which are not Fermi liquids is summarized. Finally, I discuss how the strongly-coupled phases of quantum matter may be described by gauge-gravity duality.

We show in detail how this fluctuation is reduced by exchange in the ideal Fermi gas and further reduced by Coulomb correlation in the interacting Fermi gas. Besides the mean particle number N$\Omega$ and mean square fluctuation ($\Delta$N$\Omega$)2=(N2)$\Omega$−(N$\Omega$)2, we also examine the full probability distribution P$\Omega$(N). The latter is approximately Gaussian, and exactly Gaussian for $\$documentclassarticle$\$pagestyleempty$\$begindocument{$}N{_}{{\O}}mega\backslashgg1{$}$\$enddocument. More precisely, for any N$\Omega$ it is a Poisson distribution for the ideal classical gas and a modified Poisson distribution for the ideal or interacting Fermi gases. While most of our results are for nonzero densities and three dimensions, we also consider fluctuations in the low-density or strictly correlated limit and in the electron gas of one or two dimensions. In one dimension, the electrons may be strictly correlated at all finite densities.

One possible solution to these problems is the introduction of exact exchange and hybrid functionals.

To systematically assess the precision of the present implementation, calculations for the 55 molecules of the G2-1 quantum chemical test set were performed applying the PBE and PBE0 functionals. Excellent agreement for both atomization energies and geometries compared with the results obtained by GAUSSIAN 03 calculations using large basis sets (augmented correlation consistent polarized valence quadruple zeta for the geometry optimization and augmented correlation-consistent polarized valence quintuple zeta for the energy calculations) was found. The mean absolute error for atomization energies between VASP and the experiment is 8.6 and 3.7 kcalmol, as calculated with the PBE and PBE0 functionals, respectively. The mean deviations between VASP and GAUSSIAN are 0.46 and 0.49 kcalmol for the PBE and PBE0 functionals, respectively.},

abstract = {Although the existence of nematic order in iron-based superconductors is now a well-established experimental fact, its origin remains controversial. Nematic order breaks the discrete lattice rotational symmetry by making the x and y directions in the iron plane non-equivalent. This can happen because of a regular structural transition or as the result of an electronically driven instability [mdash] in particular, orbital order or spin-driven Ising-nematic order. The latter is a magnetic state that breaks rotational symmetry but preserves time-reversal symmetry. Symmetry dictates that the development of one of these orders immediately induces the other two, making the origin of nematicity a physics realization of the /`chicken and egg problem[rsquor]. In this Review, we argue that the evidence strongly points to an electronic mechanism of nematicity, placing nematic order in the class of correlation-driven electronic instabilities, like superconductivity and density-wave transitions. We discuss different microscopic models for nematicity and link them to the properties of the magnetic and superconducting states, providing a unified perspective on the phase diagram of the iron pnictides.},

A general formalism for calculating the instantaneous corre- lation between any two spins is developed and applied to the investigation of short- and long-range order. Both models show nonvanishing long-range order in the ground state for a range of values of a certain parameter $\lambda$which is analogous to an anisotropy parameter in the Heisenberg model. A detailed comparison with the Heisenberg model suggests that the latter has no long-range order in the isotropic case but finite long-range order for any finite amount of anisotropy. The unreliability of variational methods for determin- ing long-range order is emphasized. It is also shown that for spin 1/2 systems having rather general isotropic Heisenberg interactions favoring an antiferromagnetic ordering, the ground state is nondegenerate and there is no energy gap above the ground state in the energy spectrum of the total system.},

The proposed Hamiltonian was found to not only explain all the known aspects of the Rashba phenomena but also correctly predict properties that were not known before. It brings about shifts from spin-based to OAM-based approaches in the understanding of the Rashba effect. Here, we review the developments in the new approach. Starting from a brief introduction, issues in the conventional understanding of the Rashba effect are discussed. It is then described in detail that local OAM results in significant electrostatic energy which along with the atomic spin-orbit coupling explains the Rashba effect. Experimental evidences for the existence of OAM from circular dichroism in angle resolved photoemission, thus the validity of the model, are also reviewed.},

Reduced screening in two dimensions results in markedly enhanced electron-electron interactions, which have been predicted to generate giant bandgap renormalization and excitonic effects. Here we present a rigorous experimental observation of extraordinarily large exciton binding energy in a 2D semiconducting TMD. We determine the single-particle electronic bandgap of single-layer MoSe 2 by means of scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS), as well as the two-particle exciton transition energy using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. These yield an exciton binding energy of 0.55 eV for monolayer MoSe 2 on graphene - orders of magnitude larger than what is seen in conventional 3D semiconductors and significantly higher than what we see for MoSe 2 monolayers in more highly screening environments. This finding is corroborated by our ab initio GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations which include electron correlation effects. The renormalized bandgap and large exciton binding observed here will have a profound impact on electronic and optoelectronic device technologies based on single-layer semiconducting TMDs.},

To investigate possible sources of this distinctively different superconducting behavior, we quantify the differences using first principles density functional theory, establishing first that the Fe total 3d occupations are identical in the two compounds. Individual 3d orbital occupations also differ very little ({$}\backslashsim 0.01{$}). The differences in Fermi surfaces (FSs) do not seem significant; however a redistribution of bands just above the Fermi level does represent a possibly significant distinction. Because the bands and FSs of LiFeAs are less in agreement with experiment than for other iron-pnictides, we study the effects of additional exchange-correlations effects beyond GGA (the generalized gradient approximation) by applying the modified Becke-Johnson potential (mBJ) exchange potential, which gives much improved bandgaps in insulators compared to GGA and might be useful for semimetals such as the Fe-based superconductors. Overall, we conclude that the mBJ corrections do not improve the description of LiFeAs as compared to experiment.},

The instabilities and possible ground states are studied by investigating the behaviour of the response functions. The relationship between this model and others is discussed and is used to obtain further information about the behaviour of the system. The model is generalized to a set of coupled chains to describe quasi-one-dimensional systems.

By dynamically modifying the potential bias between neighboring lattice sites, the magnitude and sign of the superexchange interaction can be controlled, thus allowing the system to be switched between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic spin interactions. We compare our findings to predictions of a two-site Bose-Hubbard model and find very good agreement, but are also able to identify corrections that can be explained by the inclusion of direct nearest-neighbor interactions.},

We consider here three transition-metal dioxide molecules (MO(2) where M = Mn, Fe, or Co), for which the equilibrium structural (e.g., bent or linear geometry) and electronic (e.g., spin or symmetry) properties have been challenging to assign both theoretically and experimentally. Augmenting a standard density-functional theory (DFT) approach with a Hubbard term (DFT+U) occasionally overlocalizes the 3d manifold, leading to an incorrect bond elongation and, in turn, poor equilibrium geometries for MO(2) molecules, while preserving good spin-state splittings. Proper description of both geometry and energetics for these molecules is recovered; however, through either calculating DFT+U relaxations at fixed M-O bond lengths or by inclusion of an intersite interaction term V that favors M(3d)-O(2p) interactions. In this latter case, both U and V are calculated fully from first-principles and are not fitting parameters. Finally, we identify an approach that more accurately determines the Hubbard U over a coordinate in which the covalent character of bonding varies.},

abstract = {Recently, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has been used to highlight an anomalously large band renormalization at high binding energies in cuprate superconductors: the high energy 'waterfall' or high energy anomaly (HEA). This paper demonstrates, using a combination of new ARPES measurements and quantum Monte Carlo simulations, that the HEA is not simply the by-product of matrix element effects, but rather represents a cross-over from a quasiparticle band at low binding energies near the Fermi level to valence bands at higher binding energy, assumed to be of strong oxygen character, in both hole- and electron-doped cuprates. While photoemission matrix elements clearly play a role in changing the aesthetic appearance of the band dispersion, i.e. the 'waterfall'-like behavior, they provide an inadequate description for the physics that underlies the strong band renormalization giving rise to the HEA. Model calculations of the single-band Hubbard Hamiltonian showcase the role played by correlations in the formation of the HEA and uncover significant differences in the HEA energy scale for hole- and electron-doped cuprates. In addition, this approach properly captures the transfer of spectral weight accompanying both hole and electron doping in a correlated material and provides a unifying description of the HEA across both sides of the cuprate phase diagram.},

@article{Kieft2012a,
abstract = {An introductory derivation of the abelian Higgs mechanism is presented. This mechanism is extended to the Standard Model electroweak symmetry group, SU (2) L × U (1) Y , where it generates the boson and fermion masses. The anal-ogy with the Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity is presented, where a Higgs-like scalar wavefunction with the familiar 'Mexican-hat' potential is shown to break the electromagnetic gauge symmetry. This renders the photon massive, leading to the physically observable Meissner effect. The microscopic theory of superconductivity (BCS) is given, where the G-L wavefunction is shown to be the density of electron Cooper pairs (e − e −). These bosonic quasi-particles form a Bose-Einstein condensate. Consequently, the Cooper pair field has a Mexican-hat potential. The binding energy of the Cooper pairs is derived in the form of a self-consistent gap equation. By virtue of the analogy with superconductivity, a composite-Higgs field theory is presented (NJL). An attractive four-fermion in-teraction is postulated, leading to a ¯ tt condensate. The top quark is shown to obtain its mass dynamically from this condensate, through a self-consistent gap-like equation. This condensate carries the correct quantum numbers to break the electroweak symmetry. A physically observable composite scalar quasi-particle ¯ tt is predicted with a mass 2m t , which replaces the fundamental Higgs boson. Populair wetenschappelijke samenvatting (Dutch) Het Higgsdeeltje is een van de meest besproken, maar vooral een van de duurste deeltjes in de natuurkunde: vele miljarden euro's werden besteed aan de zoektocht naar dit bijzondere deeltje. Het vinden van het Higgsdeeltje was zo belangrijk, omdat het de theorie ondersteunt die een verklaring biedt voor het fenomeen 'massa'. De Higgstheorie voorspelt dat het hele universum gevuld is met een soort 'zee' van Higgsdeeltjes. Alle andere deeltjes ondervinden van deze 'zee' een weerstand, waardoor ze massief worden. Alhoewel, nie alle deeltjes krijgen een massa: fotonen blijven massaloos. Dit komt omdat fotonen geen interactie aangaan met het Higgsveld. Dit kun je je als volgt voorstellen. Stel dat je op een feestje bent, en alle gasten staan rustig pratend gelijk verspreid door de feestzaal. Deze mensen stellen het Higgsveld voor. Plotseling komt er een beroemdheid binnen, bijvoorbeeld Einstein. Iedereen zal meteen naar hem toegaan om met hem te praten. Eenmaal in beweging, zal het voor Einstein moeilijker worden om tot stilstand te komen door deze massa mensen die aan hem kleeft. En als hij eenmaal gestopt is, is het moeilijker om weer in gang te komen. Als we massa opvatten als traagheid, de weerstand tegen snelheidsveranderingen, dan zien we dat Einsteins massa is toegenomen. Een onbekend persoon zal zich daarentegen moeiteloos door de feestende massa een weg weten te banen, omdat niemand hem aandacht geeft. Zijn massa wordt dus niet of nauwelijks vergroot. Dit is het verschil tussen zware deeltjes (beroemdheden) en lichte deeltjes (onbekende personen). Bovenstaande heeft allemaal te maken met de tak van de natuurkunde die 'deeltjesfysica' wordt genoemd. In een andere tak van de natuurkunde, de 'vastestoffysica' (fysica van o.a. metalen), is het Higgsmechanisme ook aanwezig, namelijk in zogeheten supergeleiders. Dit zijn metalen die bij zeer lage temperaturen perfect geleidend worden n waardoor magnetische velden niet heen kunnen dringen. Deze twee effecten laten zien dat in een supergeleider helemaal geen elektromagnetische velden kunnen bestaan. Dit komt erop neer dat fotonen massief zijn geworden binnenin een supergeleider. We weten wat hier de oorzaak van is: Als een metaal koud genoeg wordt, zullen de geleidende elektronen zich z{\'{o}} gedragen dat ze altijd in een gebonden toestand zitten met een ander elektron. Dit elektronenpaar noem je een Cooperpaar. Zodra alle elektronen een partner hebben gevonden, ontstaat een elektrisch geladen 'zee', oftewel een condensaat van Cooperparen. Fotonen zullen een interactie aangaan met dit geladen condensaat, waardoor ze een massa krijgen (denk aan Einstein op het feestje!). In de deeltjesfysica wilde men onderzoeken of het Higgsveld niet eigenlijk ook een soort Cooperpaar condensaat is, maar dan van iets andere deeltjes. Deze deeltjes heten quarks, en we zijn voornamelijk genteresseerd in het zwaarste type quark, de topquark. Het Higgsdeeltje is dan een Cooperpaar van twee topquarks. Dit wijkt af van de standaardvisie op Higgs, waar het als een nieuw fundamenteel deeltje wordt beschouwd. Je kunt uitrekenen hoe zwaar het Higgsdeeltje zou zijn als het bestaat uit twee topquarks. Dit is ongeveer twee keer zo zwaar als de bij CERN waargenomen massa. We kunnen dus concluderen dat het Higgsdeeltje in ieder geval g{\'{e}}{\'{e}}n gebonden toestand is van twee topquarks. Wat Higgs dan w{\'{e}}l precies is, blijft vooralsnog de vraag. Aan de hand van meer metingen bij CERN hoopt de natuurkundige wereld binnen een aantal jaar een antwoord op deze vraag te hebben.},

Here, we report new aspects of the metal–insulator transition1–3, studied in singledomain vanadium dioxide nanobeams4–6. We have observed supercooling of the metallic phase by 50 8C, an activation energy in the insulating phase that is consistent with the optical gap, and a connection between the metal–insulator transition and the equilibrium carrier density in the insulating phase. Our devices also provide a nanomechanical method for determining the transition temperature, enable measurements on individual metal–insulator interphase walls to be made, and allow general investigations of phase transitions in quasi-onedimensional geometries.},

abstract = {Stoichiometric LiFeAs at ambient pressure is an 18 K superconductor while isoelectronic MgFeGe is not, despite their extremely similar electronic structures. To investigate possible sources of this distinctively different superconducting behavior, we quantify the differences using first principles density functional theory, establishing first that the Fe total 3d occupations are identical in the two compounds. Individual 3d orbital occupations also differ very little ($\sim 0.01$). The differences in Fermi surfaces (FSs) do not seem significant; however a redistribution of bands just above the Fermi level does represent a possibly significant distinction. Because the bands and FSs of LiFeAs are less in agreement with experiment than for other iron-pnictides, we study the effects of additional exchange-correlations effects beyond GGA (the generalized gradient approximation) by applying the modified Becke-Johnson potential (mBJ) exchange potential, which gives much improved bandgaps in insulators compared to GGA and might be useful for semimetals such as the Fe-based superconductors. Overall, we conclude that the mBJ corrections do not improve the description of LiFeAs as compared to experiment.},

The results indicated that all the VO2 films exhibited polycrystalline structure, with a (011) preferred orientation. But Ti doping affected the morphology of the films remarkably, which then led to varied phase transition properties. Particularly, the phase transition temperature elevated by increasing the doping concentration of Ti (from 61 {\textdegree}C for pure film to 71.5 {\textdegree}C for the film doped with 2.8 at.% Ti), and the hysteresis loop decreased simultaneously. This study proposed a new method to prepare Ti-doped VO2 film and provided considerable insights for the application of Ti-doped VO2 film due to its unique phase transition properties.},

abstract = {The recent discovery of superconductivity in the iron oxypnictide family of compounds has generated intense interest. The layered crystal structure with transition-metal ions in planar square-lattice form and the discovery of spin-density-wave order near 130 K (refs 10, 11) seem to hint at a strong similarity with the copper oxide superconductors. An important current issue is the nature of the ground state of the parent compounds. Two distinct classes of theories, distinguished by the underlying band structure, have been put forward: a local-moment antiferromagnetic ground state in the strong-coupling approach, and an itinerant ground state in the weak-coupling approach. The first approach stresses on-site correlations, proximity to a Mott-insulating state and, thus, the resemblance to the high-transition-temperature copper oxides, whereas the second approach emphasizes the itinerant-electron physics and the interplay between the competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic fluctuations. The debate over the two approaches is partly due to the lack of conclusive experimental information on the electronic structures. Here we report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) of LaOFeP (superconducting transition temperature, T(c) = 5.9 K), the first-reported iron-based superconductor. Our results favour the itinerant ground state, albeit with band renormalization. In addition, our data reveal important differences between these and copper-based superconductors.},

abstract = {X-ray spectroscopy is a powerful and widely used tool for the investigation of the electronic structure of a large variety of solid-state materials, including crystals, liquids, amorphous solids, molecules, and extended states such as clusters or interfaces. The local nature of x-ray mediated electronic excitations, involving transitions to or from localized, atomic-like, core levels, makes them ideal probes of local electronic properties: bonding character, charge transfer, and local geometry. The interpretation of spectra relies on modeling the excitations accurately to provide a concrete connection between specific properties of a system and the resulting x-ray spectrum. As experimental techniques and facilities have improved, including third generation synchrotron sources and the advent of x-ray free-electron lasers, measurements have been taken on wider ranges of systems, exploring the effects of temperature and pressure, and at higher resolutions than before, but theoretical techniques have lagged. Our goal is to develop a first-principles the- oretical framework capable of achieving quantitative agreement with x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) experiments. This thesis aims to develop the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE), a particle-hole Green's function method, for describing the excited electronic state produced in core-level x-ray absorption and related spectroscopies. Building upon density functional the- ory along with self-energy corrections, our approach provides connection to experiment with minimal adjustable parameters, to both aid in interpretation and highlight unaccounted for phys- ical processes. While a fully parameter-free method for calculating x-ray spectroscopy remains elusive, our method presented here allows for quantitative comparison to experiment without system-dependent fits. This method has been implemented in the OCEAN software package, and results are presented for both insulating and metallic materials, including 3d transition metal and water systems.},

abstract = {Many theoretical models of high-temperature superconductivity focus only on the doping dependence of the CuO(2)-plane electronic structure. However, such models are manifestly insufficient to explain the strong variations in superconducting critical temperature, T(c), among cuprates that have identical hole density but are crystallographically different outside of the CuO(2) plane. A key challenge, therefore, has been to identify a predominant out-of-plane influence controlling the superconductivity, with much attention focusing on the distance d(A) between the apical oxygen and the planar copper atom. Here we report direct determination of how variations in interatomic distances within individual crystalline unit cells affect the superconducting energy-gap maximum Delta of Bi(2)Sr(2)CaCu(2)O(8+delta). In this material, quasiperiodic variations of unit cell geometry occur in the form of a bulk crystalline "supermodulation." Within each supermodulation period, we find approximately 9 +/- 1{%} cosinusoidal variation in local Delta that is anticorrelated with the associated d(A) variations. Furthermore, we show that phenomenological consistency would exist between these effects and the random Delta variations found near dopant atoms if the primary effect of the interstitial dopant atom is to displace the apical oxygen so as to diminish d(A) or tilt the CuO(5) pyramid. Thus, we reveal a strong, nonrandom out-of-plane effect on cuprate superconductivity at atomic scale.},

abstract = {Goldstone theorem implies that theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking contain at least as many massless scalar fields as there are bro- ken generators; the problem is that those massless bosons do not seem to correspond to physical particles. Similarily, non-Abelian gauge theo- ries appear to be restrained to the description of massless gauge fields, whereas a theory of the weak interaction would require massive gauge fields. However, when a gauge theory is combined with a spontaneous symmetry breaking, the two problems solve themselves in a very elegant way. In this review, we present the fundamentals of non-Abelian gauge theories, and underline their inability to deal with massive vector fields without compromising the gauge invariance. The Georgi-Glashow model will serve us as a simple example in which this flaw is cured by the effect of the Higgs mechanism. We will finally analyse some general features of theories in which the Higgs mechanism takes place.},

abstract = {The electronic structure of LaOFeAs, a parent compound of iron-arsenic superconductors, is studied by angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy. By examining its dependence on photon energy, polarization, sodium dosing and the counting of Fermi surface volume, both the bulk and the surface contributions are identified. We find that a bulk band moves toward high binding energies below structural transition, and shifts smoothly across the spin density wave transition by about 25 meV. Our data suggest the band reconstruction may play a crucial role in the spin density wave transition, and the structural transition is driven by the short range magnetic order. For the surface states, both the LaO-terminated and FeAs-terminated components are revealed. Certain small band shifts are verified for the FeAs-terminated surface states in the spin density wave state, which is a reflection of the bulk electronic structure reconstruction. Moreover, sharp quasiparticle peaks quickly rise at low temperatures, indicating of drastic reduction of the scattering rate. A kink structure in one of the surface band is shown to be possibly related to the electron-phonon interactions.},

We then propose an approximation to the functional differential equation that determines the exact one-body Green's function, whose solution has an exponential form. This yields a calculated spectrum, including cross sections, secondary electrons, and an estimate for extrinsic and interference effects, in excellent agreement with experiment. Our result can be recast as a dynamical vertex correction beyond GW, giving hints for further developments.},

@article{Kasahara2012,
abstract = {Electronic nematicity, a unidirectional self-organized state that breaks the rotational symmetry of the underlying lattice, has been observed in the iron pnictide and copper oxide high-temperature superconductors. Whether nematicity plays an equally important role in these two systems is highly controversial. In iron pnictides, the nematicity has usually been associated with the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural transition at temperature T(s). Although recent experiments have provided hints of nematicity, they were performed either in the low-temperature orthorhombic phase or in the tetragonal phase under uniaxial strain, both of which break the 90° rotational C(4) symmetry. Therefore, the question remains open whether the nematicity can exist above T(s) without an external driving force. Here we report magnetic torque measurements of the isovalent-doping system BaFe(2)(As(1-x)P(x))(2), showing that the nematicity develops well above T(s) and, moreover, persists to the non-magnetic superconducting regime, resulting in a phase diagram similar to the pseudogap phase diagram of the copper oxides. By combining these results with synchrotron X-ray measurements, we identify two distinct temperatures-one at T*, signifying a true nematic transition, and the other at T(s) (<T*), which we show not to be a true phase transition, but rather what we refer to as a 'meta-nematic transition', in analogy to the well-known meta-magnetic transition in the theory of magnetism.},

abstract = {The electronic ground state of a periodic system is usually described in terms of extended Bloch orbitals, simultaneous eigenstates of the periodic Hamiltonian and of the direct lattice translations. An alternative representation in terms of localized orbitals has been introduced by Gregory Wannier in 1937; besides its theoretical relevance in several areas of solid-state theory, it has gained recent prominence due to its connection with the Berry-phase theory of bulk polarization, the interest in linear-scaling approaches, and with the development of general algorithms to derive Wannier functions in the framework of first-principles electronic structure calculations. The connection between the Bloch representation and the Wannier representation is realized by families of transformations in a continuous space of unitary matrices, carrying a large degree of arbitrariness. A few years ago we have developed a localization algorithm that allows one to iteratively transform the extended Bloch orbitals of a first-principles calculation into a unique set of maximally-localized Wannier functions (MLWFs), extending and encompassing Boys formulation for molecules to the solid-state case. The localization algorithm is independent of the single-particle electronic structure approach adopted, or the choice of basis set, and it is straightforwardly applied to extended or periodic solids and to isolated systems. Additionally, a novel disentanglement procedure allows to extract a maximally-connected manifold of any chosen dimension from a given energy window, leading to the extension of the original algorithm to the case of systems without gaps (e.g., metals) and removing the limitation to isolated groups of bands separated by gaps from higher and lower manifolds. In this Highlight we will outline and summarize the main results of the theory and algorithm underlying the maximally-localized Wannier- functions representation, and review some of the applications that have since appeared in the literature.},

abstract = {Solar cells based on the organic-inorganic tri-halide perovskite family of materials have shown significant progress recently, offering the prospect of low-cost solar energy from devices that are very simple to process. Fundamental to understanding the operation of these devices is the exciton binding energy, which has proved both difficult to measure directly and controversial. We demonstrate that by using very high magnetic fields it is possible to make an accurate and direct spectroscopic measurement of the exciton binding energy, which we find to be only 16 meV at low temperatures, over three times smaller than has been previously assumed. In the room-temperature phase we show that the binding energy falls to even smaller values of only a few millielectronvolts, which explains their excellent device performance as being due to spontaneous free-carrier generation following light absorption. Additionally, we determine the excitonic reduced effective mass to be 0.104m e (where m e is the electron mass), significantly smaller than previously estimated experimentally but in good agreement with recent calculations. Our work provides crucial information about the photophysics of these materials, which will in turn allow improved optoelectronic device operation and better understanding of their electronic properties.},

To address the existence of negative eigenmodes in the BSE solutions, an approximation to the BSE kernel is proposed, which allows to completely remove the issue in the low electron density region considered.

abstract = {Following the discovery of long-range antiferromagnetic order in the parent compounds of high-transition-temperature (high-T(c)) copper oxides, there have been efforts to understand the role of magnetism in the superconductivity that occurs when mobile 'electrons' or 'holes' are doped into the antiferromagnetic parent compounds. Superconductivity in the newly discovered rare-earth iron-based oxide systems ROFeAs (R, rare-earth metal) also arises from either electron or hole doping of their non-superconducting parent compounds. The parent material LaOFeAs is metallic but shows anomalies near 150 K in both resistivity and d.c. magnetic susceptibility. Although optical conductivity and theoretical calculations suggest that LaOFeAs exhibits a spin-density-wave (SDW) instability that is suppressed by doping with electrons to induce superconductivity, there has been no direct evidence of SDW order. Here we report neutron-scattering experiments that demonstrate that LaOFeAs undergoes an abrupt structural distortion below 155 K, changing the symmetry from tetragonal (space group P4/nmm) to monoclinic (space group P112/n) at low temperatures, and then, at approximately 137 K, develops long-range SDW-type antiferromagnetic order with a small moment but simple magnetic structure. Doping the system with fluorine suppresses both the magnetic order and the structural distortion in favour of superconductivity. Therefore, like high-T(c) copper oxides, the superconducting regime in these iron-based materials occurs in close proximity to a long-range-ordered antiferromagnetic ground state.},

This is shown by taking some branes in the full M/string theory and then taking a low energy limit where the field theory on the brane decouples from the bulk. We observe that, in this limit, we can still trust the near horizon geometry for large $N$. The enhanced supersymmetries of the near horizon geometry correspond to the extra supersymmetry generators present in the superconformal group (as opposed to just the super-Poincare group). The 't Hooft limit of 4-d ${\cal N} =4$ super-Yang-Mills at the conformal point is shown to contain strings: they are IIB strings. We conjecture that compactifications of M/string theory on various Anti-deSitter spacetimes are dual to various conformal field theories. This leads to a new proposal for a definition of M-theory which could be extended to include five non-compact dimensions.},

This analysis is performed based on pure Yang-Mills theories in the Landau gauge, within the theoretical framework that emerges from the combination of the pinch technique with the background field method. In particular, we concentrate on the Schwinger-Dyson equation satisfied by the gluon propagator and examine the necessary conditions for obtaining finite solutions within the infrared region. The role of seagull diagrams receives particular attention, as do the identities that enforce the cancellation of all potential quadratic divergences. We stress the necessity of introducing nonperturbative massless poles in the fully dressed vertices of the theory in order to trigger the Schwinger mechanism, and explain in detail the instrumental role of these poles in maintaining the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin symmetry at every step of the mass-generating procedure. The dynamical equation governing the evolution of the gluon mass is derived, and its solutions are determined numerically following implementation of a set of simplifying assumptions. The obtained mass function is positive definite, and exhibits a power law running that is consistent with general arguments based on the operator product expansion in the ultraviolet region. A possible connection between confinement and the presence of an inflection point in the gluon propagator is briefly discussed.},

abstract = {This study is one of a series of researches on polymer-assisted deposition (PAD) of thermochromic VO2 film. This paper describes the synthesis of Ti-doped VO2 films (V1-xTixO2, x=00.167) and a systematic investigation of the effects of Ti doping on morphology, crystalline phase and optical properties (visible transmittance, transmittance changes in near infrared (NIR) light across the metalinsulator transition (MIT), absorption edge, MIT temperatures and sharpness) of V 1-xTixO2 films. The films showed excellent visible transmittance and large changes (∼50% at 2000 nm) in the NIR-light transmittance before and after MIT for samples with a wide range of Ti contents (010%). The width of the hysteresis loop was severely reduced, which is in agreement with a qualitative analysis using the nucleation theory, while the MIT sharpness was not obviously influenced. An increase in the MIT temperature was observed for all samples with Ti doping, in particular 18.5 °C for 2% Ti doping, which is quite large compared with those in the literature. However, the MIT seemed saturated at around 80 °C. The morphology evolution of Ti-doped VO2 films was investigated for the first time. Interestingly, Ti doping could remarkably reduce the particle size of VO2 films due to Ti enhanced heterogeneous nucleation process of VO2 particles, indicating a new method for the growth of nanostructured VO2 films. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We provide the rules of transformation of Weyl spinors, both at the classical level (grassmanian wave functions) and quantum level (operators). Making use of Wightman's definition of invariance, we outline ambiguities linked to the notion of classical fermionic Lagrangian. We then present the general constraints cast by these transformations and their products on the propagator of the simplest among coupled fermionic system, the one made with one fermion and its antifermion. Last, we put in correspondence the propagation of C eigenstates (Majorana fermions) and the criteria cast on their propagator by C and CP invariance. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Present local and semilocal functionals show significant errors, for instance, in the energetics of small molecules and in the description of band gaps. One possible solution to these problems is the introduction of exact exchange and hybrid functionals. A plane-wave-based algorithm was implemented in VASP (Vienna ab-initio simulation package) to allow for the calculation of the exact exchange. To systematically assess the precision of the present implementation, calculations for the 55 molecules of the G2-1 quantum chemical test set were performed applying the PBE and PBE0 functionals. Excellent agreement for both atomization energies and geometries compared with the results obtained by GAUSSIAN 03 calculations using large basis sets (augmented correlation consistent polarized valence quadruple zeta for the geometry optimization and augmented correlation-consistent polarized valence quintuple zeta for the energy calculations) was found. The mean absolute error for atomization energies between VASP and the experiment is 8.6 and 3.7 kcalmol, as calculated with the PBE and PBE0 functionals, respectively. The mean deviations between VASP and GAUSSIAN are 0.46 and 0.49 kcalmol for the PBE and PBE0 functionals, respectively.},

abstract = {This book gathers the lecture notes of courses given at the 2010 summer school in theoretical physics in Les Houches, France, Session XCIV. Written in a pedagogical style, this volume illustrates how the field of quantum gases has flourished at the interface between atomic physics and quantum optics, condensed matter physics, nuclear and high-energy physics, non-linear physics and quantum information. The physics of correlated atoms in optical lattices is covered from both theoretical and experimental perspectives, including the Bose and Fermi Hubbard models, and the description of the Mott transition. Few-body physics with cold atoms has made spectacular progress and exact solutions for 3-body and 4-body problems have been obtained. The remarkable collisional stability of weakly bound molecules is at the core of the studies of molecular BEC regimes in Fermi gases. Entanglement in quantum many-body systems is introduced and is a key issue for quantum information processing. Rapidly rotating quantum gases and optically induced gauge fields establish a remarkable connection with the fractional quantum Hall effect for electrons in semiconductors. Dipolar quantum gases with long range and anisotropic interaction lead to new quantum degenerate regimes in atoms with large magnetic moments, or electrically aligned polar molecules. Experiments with ultracold fermions show how quantum gases serve as ''quantum simulators'' of complex condensed matter systems through measurements of the equation of state. Similarly, the recent observation of Anderson localization of matter waves in a disordered optical potential makes a fruitful link with the behaviour of electrons in disordered systems.},

abstract = {It is argued that the wave function representing an excitation in liquid helium should be nearly of the form $\Sigma$if(ri)$\phi$, where $\phi$ is the ground-state wave function, f(r) is some function of position, and the sum is taken over each atom i. In the variational principle this trial function minimizes the energy if f(r)=exp(ik{{\textperiodcentered}}r), the energy value being E(k)=ℏ2k2/2mS(k), where S(k) is the structure factor of the liquid for neutron scattering. For small k, E rises linearly (phonons). For larger k, S(k) has a maximum which makes a ring in the diffraction pattern and a minimum in the E(k) vs k curve. Near the minimum, E(k) behaves as $\Delta$+ℏ2(k-k0)2/2$\mu$, which form Landau found agrees with the data on specific heat. The theoretical value of $\Delta$ is twice too high, however, indicating need of a better trial function. Excitations near the minimum are shown to behave in all essential ways like the rotons postulated by Landau. The thermodynamic and hydrodynamic equations of the two-fluid model are discussed from this view. The view is not adequate to deal with the details of the $\lambda$ transition and with problems of critical flow velocity. In a dilute solution of He3 atoms in He4, the He3 should move essentially as free particles but of higher effective mass. This mass is calculated, in an appendix, to be about six atomic mass units.},

abstract = {Unconventional superconductivity typically occurs in materials in which a small change of a parameter such as bandwidth or doping leads to antiferromagnetic or Mott insulating phases. As such competing phases are approached, the properties of the superconductor often become increasingly exotic. For example, in organic superconductors and underdoped high-T(c) cuprate superconductors a fluctuating superconducting state persists to temperatures significantly above T(c). By studying alloys of quasi-two-dimensional organic molecular metals in the $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)₂X family, we reveal how the Nernst effect, a sensitive probe of superconducting phase fluctuations, evolves in the regime of extreme Mott criticality. We find strong evidence that, as the phase diagram is traversed through superconductivity towards the Mott state, the temperature scale for superconducting fluctuations increases dramatically, eventually approaching the temperature at which quasiparticles become identifiable at all.},

abstract = {Unconventional superconductivity (SC) is said to occur when Cooper pair formation is dominated by repulsive electron-electron interactions, so that the symmetry of the pair wave function is other than an isotropic s-wave. The strong, on-site, repulsive electron-electron interactions that are the proximate cause of such SC are more typically drivers of commensurate magnetism. Indeed, it is the suppression of commensurate antiferromagnetism (AF) that usually allows this type of unconventional superconductivity to emerge. Importantly, however, intervening between these AF and SC phases, intertwined electronic ordered phases (IP) of an unexpected nature are frequently discovered. For this reason, it has been extremely difficult to distinguish the microscopic essence of the correlated superconductivity from the often spectacular phenomenology of the IPs. Here we introduce a model conceptual framework within which to understand the relationship between AF electron-electron interactions, IPs, and correlated SC. We demonstrate its effectiveness in simultaneously explaining the consequences of AF interactions for the copper-based, iron-based, and heavy-fermion superconductors, as well as for their quite distinct IPs.},

abstract = {In symmetric quantum dots (QDs), it is well known that the spin hot spot (i.e., the cusplike structure due to the presence of degeneracy near the level or anticrossing point) is present for the pure Rashba case but is absent for the pure Dresselhaus case [Bulaev and Loss, Phys. Rev. Lett.PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/ PhysRevLett.95.076805 95, 076805 (2005)]. Since the Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling dominates over the Rashba spin-orbit coupling in GaAs and GaSb QDs, it is important to find the exact location of the spin hot spot or the cusplike structure even for the pure Dresselhaus case. In this paper, we present analytical and numerical results that show that the spin hot spot can also be seen for the pure Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling case by inducing large anisotropy through external gates. At or nearby the spin hot spot, the spin transition rate increases and the decoherence time decreases by several orders of magnitude compared to the case with no spin hot spot. Thus one should avoid such locations when designing QD spin based transistors for possible implementation in quantum logic gates, solid-state quantum computing, and quantum information processing. It is also possible to extract the exact experimental data [Amasha, MacLean, Radu, Zumb{\"{u}}hl, Kastner, Hanson, and Gossard, Phys. Rev.

We have observed supercooling of the metallic phase by 50 8C, an activation energy in the insulating phase that is consistent with the optical gap, and a connection between the metal–insulator transition and the equilibrium carrier density in the insulating phase. Our devices also provide a nanomechanical method for determining the transition temperature, enable measurements on individual metal–insulator interphase walls to be made, and allow general investigations of phase transitions in quasi-onedimensional geometries.},

abstract = {Twistor theory offers a new approach, starting with conformally-invariant concepts, to the synthesis of quantum theory and relativity. Twistors for flat space-time are the SU(2,2) spinors of the twofold covering group O(2,4) of the conformal group. They describe the momentum and angular momentum structre of zero-rest-mass particles. Space-time points arise as secondary concepts corresponding to linear sets in twistor space. They, rather than the null cones, should become “smeared out” on passage to a quantised gravitational theory. Twistors are represented here in two-component spinor terms. Zero-rest-mass fields are described by holomorphic functions on twistor space, on which there is a natural canonical structure leading to a natural choice of canonical quantum operators. The generalisation to curved space can be accomplished in three ways; i) local twistors, a conformally invariant calculus, ii) global twistors, and iii) asymptotic twistors which provide the framework for an S-matrix approach in asymptotically flat space-times. A Hamiltonian scattering theory of global twistors is used to calculate scattering cross-sections. This leads to twistor analogues of Feynman graphs for the treatment of massless quantum electrodynamics. The recent development of methods for dealing with massive (conformal symmetry breaking) sources and fields is briefly reviewed.},

The expansion in ϵ = 4−d is explained [d is the dimension of space (statistical mechanics) or space-time (quantum field theory)]. The emphasis is on principles, not particular applications. Sections 1–8 provide a self-contained introduction at a fairly elementary level to the statistical mechanical theory. No background is required except for some prior experience with diagrams. In particular, a diagrammatic approximation to an exact renormalization group equation is presented in sections 4 and 5; sections 6–8 include the approximate renormalization group recursion formula and the Feyman graph method for calculating exponents. Sections 10–13 go deeper into renormalization group theory (section 9 presents a calculation of anomalous dimensions). The equivalence of quantum field theory and classical statistical mechanics near the critical point is established in section 10; sections 11–13 concern problems common to both subjects. Specific field theoretic references assume some background in quantum field theory. An exact renormalization group equation is presented in section 11; sections 12 and 13 concern fundamental topological questions.},

In large molecules and solids, however, calculating the exact (Hartree-Fock) exchange is computationally expensive, especially for systems with metallic characteristics. In the present work, we develop a new hybrid density functional based on a screened Coulomb potential for the exchange interaction which circumvents this bottleneck. The results obtained for structural and thermodynamic properties of molecules are comparable in quality to the most widely used hybrid functionals. In addition, we present results of periodic boundary condition calculations for both semiconducting and metallic single wall carbon nanotubes. Using a screened Coulomb potential for Hartree-Fock exchange enables fast and accurate hybrid calculations, even of usually difficult metallic systems. The high accuracy of the new screened Coulomb potential hybrid, combined with its computational advantages, makes it widely applicable to large molecules and periodic systems.

abstract = {Doping a Mott-insulating $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid can lead to a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*). Such a phase has several favorable features that make it a candidate for the pseudogap metal for the underdoped cuprates. We focus on a particular, simple $\mathbb{Z}_2$-FL* state which can undergo a confinement transition to a spatially uniform superconductor which is smoothly connected to the `plain vanilla' BCS superconductor with $d$-wave pairing. Such a transition occurs by the condensation of bosonic particles carrying $+e$ charge but no spin (`chargons'). We show that modifying the dispersion of the bosonic chargons can lead to confinement transitions with charge density waves and pair density waves at the same wave-vector $\mathbf{K}$, co-existing with $d$-wave superconductivity. We also compute the evolution of the Hall number in the normal state during the transition from the plain vanilla FL* state to a Fermi liquid, and argue, following Coleman $\it{ et \, al.}$, that it exhibits a discontinuous jump near optimal doping. We note the distinction between these results and those obtained from models of the pseudogap with fermionic chargons.},

abstract = {This article describes the variational and fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo methods and how they may be used to calculate the properties of many-electron systems. These stochastic wave-function-based approaches provide a very direct treatment of quantum many-body effects and serve as benchmarks against which other techniques may be compared. They complement the less demanding density-functional approach by providing more accurate results and a deeper understanding of the physics of electronic correlation in real materials. The algorithms are intrinsically parallel, and currently available high-performance computers allow applications to systems containing a thousand or more electrons. With these tools one can study complicated problems such as the properties of surfaces and defects, while including electron correlation effects with high precision. The authors provide a pedagogical overview of the techniques and describe a selection of applications to ground and excited states of solids and clusters.},

abstract = {Particles with spin have extra degrees of freedom which transform nontrivially under rotations. Such particles are therefore characterized by the value of their momentum and by the orientation of their " spin " . For spin-1 this orientation is described by a three-dimensional spin vector. Quantum-mechanically, for given momentum, there are three independent states distinguishable by the value of the spin projected along a certain axis (in this case these values are ±1 and 0 in units of However, massless particles with spin are special, because their spin can only be directed parallel or anti-parallel to their direction of motion. Hence, massless particles with spin have only two different spin states, irrespective of the value of their total spin. This chapter deals with spin-1 particles, also called vector particles. Well-known examples of massive spin-1 particles are the mesons $\rho$, $\phi$, J/$\psi$ and $\Upsilon$, and the weak intermediate vector bosons W ± and Z. The only known massless spin-1 particle is the photon. Free massive spin-1 fields are described by the Proca Lagrangian, and massless spin-1 fields by the Maxwell Lagrangian. We shall discuss four typical particle reactions that involve photons, namely electromagnetic scattering of pions, pion-Compton scattering, the decay $\pi$ 0 → $\gamma$$\gamma$, and the radiative decay K 0 S → $\pi$ + $\pi$ − $\gamma$. The first and the third term are a straightforward generalization of the Klein-Gordon Lagrangian for scalar fields; the relevance of the second term will become clear shortly. The field equations corresponding to (4.1) follow from Hamilton's principle, according to which we require that the action be sta-tionary under small variations V µ → V µ + $\delta$V µ , where $\delta$V µ , vanishes at the boundary of the integration domain of the action integral. Hence we consider, $\delta$S = − d 4 x ∂ µ V $\nu$ − ∂ $\nu$ V µ ∂ µ $\delta$V $\nu$ + m 2 V µ $\delta$V µ (x) = 0 . (4.2)},

We first study renormalizability in the language of renormalization group flows for a toy renormalization group equation. We then derive an exact renormalization group equation for a four-dimensional $\lambda${{\o}}4 theory with a momentum cutoff. We organize the cutoff dependence of the effective lagrangian into relevant and irrelevant parts, and derive a linear equation for the irrelevant part. A lengthy but straightforward argument establishes that the piece identified as irrelevant actually is so in perturbation theory. This implies renormalizability. The method extends immediately to any system in which a momentum-space cutoff can be used, but the principle is more general and should apply for any physical cutoff. Neither Weinberg's theorem nor arguments based on the topology of graphs are needed.},

@article{Zhu2015,
abstract = {The concept of a charge density wave (CDW) permeates much of condensed matter physics and chemistry. CDWs have their origin rooted in the instability of a one-dimensional system described by Peierls. The extension of this concept to reduced dimensional systems has led to the concept of Fermi surface nesting (FSN), which dictates the wave vector [Formula: see text] of the CDW and the corresponding lattice distortion. The idea is that segments of the Fermi contours are connected by [Formula: see text], resulting in the effective screening of phonons inducing Kohn anomalies in their dispersion at [Formula: see text], driving a lattice restructuring at low temperatures. There is growing theoretical and experimental evidence that this picture fails in many real systems and in fact it is the momentum dependence of the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) matrix element that determines the characteristic of the CDW phase. Based on the published results for the prototypical CDW system 2H-NbSe2, we show how well the [Formula: see text]-dependent EPC matrix element, but not the FSN, can describe the origin of the CDW. We further demonstrate a procedure of combing electronic band and phonon measurements to extract the EPC matrix element, allowing the electronic states involved in the EPC to be identified. Thus, we show that a large EPC does not necessarily induce the CDW phase, with Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+$\delta$ as the example, and the charge-ordered phenomena observed in various cuprates are not driven by FSN or EPC. To experimentally resolve the microscopic picture of EPC will lead to a fundamental change in the way we think about, write about, and classify charge density waves.},

Clearly superconductivity and magnetism/magnetic fluctuations are intimately related in the FePn/Ch - and even coexist in some. Open questions, including the superconducting nodal structure in a number of compounds, abound and are often dependent on improved sample quality for their solution. With Tc values up to 56 K, the six distinct Fe-containing superconducting structures exhibit complex but often comparable behaviors. The search for correlations and explanations in this fascinating field of research would benefit from an organization of the large, seemingly disparate data set.

Understanding how the material evolves from metal to insulator is a fundamental and open question. Early studies in high magnetic fields revealed that below some critical doping an insulator-like upturn appears in the resistivity of cuprates at low temperature, but its origin has remained a puzzle. Here we propose that this 'metal-to-insulator crossover' is due to a drop in carrier density n associated with the onset of the pseudogap phase at a critical doping p*. We use high-field resistivity measurements on LSCO to show that the upturns are quantitatively consistent with a drop from n=1+p above p* to n=p below p*, in agreement with high-field Hall data in YBCO. We demonstrate how previously reported upturns in the resistivity of LSCO, YBCO and Nd-LSCO are explained by the same universal mechanism: a drop in carrier density by 1.0 hole per Cu atom.},

Technical aspects and modifications related to the choice of basis functions (energy parameters, core--valence orthogonality, extended local orbitals) that affect the applicability and accuracy of the method are described, as well as an approach for obtaining k -independent matrix elements. The inclusion of external electric fields is illustrated by results for the induced densities at the surfaces of both magnetic and non-magnetic metals, and the relationship to image planes and to nonlinear effects such as second harmonic generation. The magnetic coupling of core hole excitations in Fe, the calculation of intrinsic defect formation energies, the concentration-dependent chemical potentials, entropic contributions, and the relative phase stability of Zr-rich Zr--Al alloys are also discussed.},

With increasing sheet carrier density, both QW structures show that the exciton binding energy is significantly reduced, suggesting that excitons are nearly bleached at typical densities (approximately 1013 cm-2) for which lasing occurs. The exciton binding energy of ZnO/MgZnO QW structures is shown to be much larger than that of GaN/AlGaN QW structures. This can be explained by the fact that ZnO/MgZnO QW structures have a larger matrix element than the GaN/AlGaN QW structures. Also, the self-consistent model of both QW structures shows that, with the inclusion of the internal field, the exciton binding energy is substantially reduced compared to that of the flat-band value.},

abstract = {The precise nature of unconventional superconductivity (SC) in iron pnictides is presently a hotly debated issue. Here, using insights from normal state electronic structure and symmetry arguments, we show how an unconventional SC emerges from the bad metal "normal" state. Short-ranged, multiband spin and charge correlations generate nodeless SC in the active planar d(xz,yz) bands, and an interband proximity effect induces out-of-plane gap nodes in the passive d(3z)(2)-r(2) band. While very good quantitative agreement with various key observations in the SC state and reconciliation with NMR and penetration depth data in the same picture are particularly attractive features of our proposal, clinching evidence would be an experimental confirmation of c-axis nodes in future work.},

abstract = {This article reviews the theory of electron-phonon interactions in solids from the point of view of ab-initio calculations. While the electron-phonon interaction has been studied for almost a century, predictive non-empirical calculations have become feasible only during the past two decades. Today it is possible to calculate from first principles many materials properties related to the electron-phonon interaction, including the critical temperature of conventional superconductors, the carrier mobility in semiconductors, the temperature dependence of optical spectra in direct and indirect-gap semiconductors, the relaxation rates of photoexcited carriers, the electron mass renormalization in angle-resolved photoelectron spectra, and the non-adiabatic corrections to phonon dispersion relations. Here we review the theoretical and computational framework underlying modern electron-phonon calculations from first principles, as well as landmark investigations of the electron-phonon interaction in real materials. In the first part of the article we summarize the elementary theory of electron-phonon interactions and their calculations based on density-functional theory. In the second part we discuss a general field-theoretic formulation of the electron-phonon problem, and establish the connection with practical first-principles calculations. In the third part we review a number of recent investigations of electron-phonon interactions in the areas of vibrational spectroscopy, photoelectron spectoscopy, optical spectroscopy, transport, and superconductivity.},

@article{Schwinger1948,
abstract = {Attempts to avoid the divergence difficulties of quantum electrodynamics by multilation of the theory have been uniformly unsuccessful. The lack of convergence does indicate that a revision of electrodynamic concepts at ultrarelativistic energies is indeed necessary, but no appreciable alteration of the theory for moderate relativistic energies can be tolerated. The elementary phenomena in which divergences occur, in consequence of virtual transitions involving particles with unlimited energy, are the polarization of the vacuum and the self-energy of the electron, effects which essentially express the interaction of the electromagnetic and matter fields with their own vacuum fluctuations. The basic result of these fluctuation interactions is to alter the constants characterizing the properties of the individual fields, and their mutual coupling, albeit by infinite factors. The question is naturally posed whether all divergences can be isolated in such unobservable renormalization factors; more specifically, we inquire whether quantum electrodynamics can account unambiguously for the recently observed deviations from the Dirac electron theory, without the introduction of fundamentally new concepts. This paper, the first in a series devoted to the above question, is occupied with the formulation of a completely covariant electrodynamics. Manifest covariance with respect to Lorentz and gauge transformations is essential in a divergent theory since the use of a particular reference system or gauge in the course of calculation can result in a loss of covariance in view of the ambiguities that may be the concomitant of infinities. It is remarked, in the first section, that the customary canonical commutation relations, which fail to exhibit the desired covariance since they refer to field variables at equal times and different points of space, can be put in covariant form by replacing the four-dimensional surface t=const. by a space-like surface. The latter is such that light signals cannot be propagated between any two points on the surface. In this manner, a formulation of quantum electrodynamics is constructed in the Heisenberg representation, which is obviously covariant in all its aspects. It is not entirely suitable, however, as a practical means of treating electrodynamic questions, since commutators of field quantities at points separated by a time-like interval can be constructed only by solving the equations of motion. This situation is to be contrasted with that of the Schr{{\"{o}}}dinger representation, in which all operators refer to the same time, thus providing a distinct separation between kinematical and dynamical aspects. A formulation that retains the evident covariance of the Heisenberg representation, and yet offers something akin to the advantage of the Schr{{\"{o}}}dinger representation can be based on the distinction between the properties of non-interacting fields, and the effects of coupling between fields. In the second section, we construct a canonical transformation that changes the field equations in the Heisenberg representation into those of non-interacting fields, and therefore describes the coupling between fields in terms of a varying state vector. It is then a simple matter to evaluate commutators of field quantities at arbitrary space-time points. One thus obtains an obviously convariant and practical form of quantum electrodynamics, expressed in a mixed Heisenberg-Schr{{\"{o}}}dinger representation, which is called the interaction representation. The third section is devoted to a discussion of the covariant elimination of the longitudinal field, in which the customary distinction between longitudinal and transverse fields is replaced by a suitable covariant definition. The fourth section is concerned with the description of collision processes in terms of an invariant collision operator, which is the unitary operator that determines the over-all change in state of a system as the result of interaction. It is shown that the collision operator is simply related to the Hermitian reaction operator, for which a variational principle is constructed.},

abstract = {The electronic and structural properties of a material are strongly determined by its symmetry. Changing the symmetry via a photoinduced phase transition offers new ways to manipulate material properties on ultrafast timescales. However, to identify when and how fast these phase transitions occur, methods that can probe the symmetry change in the time domain are required. Here we show that a time-dependent change in the coherent phonon spectrum can probe a change in symmetry of the lattice potential, thus providing an all-optical probe of structural transitions. We examine the photoinduced structural phase transition in VO(2) and show that, above the phase transition threshold, photoexcitation completely changes the lattice potential on an ultrafast timescale. The loss of the equilibrium-phase phonon modes occurs promptly, indicating a non-thermal pathway for the photoinduced phase transition, where a strong perturbation to the lattice potential changes its symmetry before ionic rearrangement has occurred.},

@article{Bardeen1955,
abstract = {The role of electron-electron interactions in determining the electron-phonon interaction in metals is investigated by extending the Bohm-Pines collective description to take into account the ionic motion. Collective coordinates are introduced to describe the long-range electron-ionic correlations, and it is shown by a series of canonical transformations that these give rise to plasma waves and to coupled electron-ion waves which correspond to longitudinal sound waves. The dispersion relation for the sound waves is identical with that derived by Toya and Nakajima by self-consistent field methods. The velocity of these sound waves is calculated from first principles for sodium and is found to be in good agreement with experiment. The effective matrix element for the electron-phonon interaction is determined and is found to be identical for long wavelengths with that found earlier by Bardeen using a self-consistent field method which neglects exchange and correlation effects. The agreement with the earlier work is explained by the fact that the residual electron-electron interaction is of quite short range, so that an independent-particle treatment is rather well justified. The effects of Coulomb correlations on superconductivity are likewise shown to be small, so that the neglect of Coulomb interactions in the formulation of the superconductivity problem is justified.},

Static, unidirectional electronic nanostructures of dimension eight times the inter-iron-atom distance a(Fe-Fe) and aligned along the crystal a axis are observed. In contrast, the delocalized electronic states detectable by quasiparticle interference imaging are dispersive along the b axis only and are consistent with a nematic alpha2 band with an apparent band folding having wave vector q vector congruent with +/-2pi/8a(Fe-Fe) along the a axis. All these effects rotate through 90 degrees at orthorhombic twin boundaries, indicating that they are bulk properties. As none of these phenomena are expected merely due to crystal symmetry, underdoped ferropnictides may exhibit a more complex electronic nematic state than originally expected.},

In contrast to this, Fe-doping near the surface produces both isovalent and heterovalent substitution (Fe3+ → Zn2+). The calculations performed herein suggest that the most likely defect structure is the single or double substitution of Zn with Fe, although, if additional oxygen is available, then Fe substitution with interstitial oxygen is even more energetically favorable. Furthermore, it is found that ferromagnetic states are energetically unfavorable, and ferromagnetic ordering is likely to be realized only through the formation of a secondary phase (i.e., ZnFe2O 4), or codoping with Cu. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {We aim to give a pedagogical introduction to those elementary aspects of superconductivity which are not treated in the classic textbooks. In particular, we emphasize that global U(1) phase rotation symmetry, and not gauge symmetry, is spontaneously violated, and show that the BCS wave function is, contrary to claims in the literature, fully gauge invariant. We discuss the nature of the order parameter, the physical origin of the many degenerate states, and the relation between formulations of superconductivity with fixed particle numbers vs. well-defined phases. We motivate and to some extend derive the effective field theory at low temperatures, explore symmetries and conservation laws, and justify the classical nature of the theory. Most importantly, we show that the entire phenomenology of superconductivity essentially follows from the single assumption of a charged order parameter field. This phenomenology includes Anderson's characteristic equations of superfluidity, electric and magnetic screening, the Bernoulli Hall effect, the balance of the Lorentz force, as well as the quantum effects, in which Planck's constant manifests itself through the compactness of the U (1) phase field. The latter effects include flux quantization, phase slippage, and the Josephson effect. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The presence of a Rashba band-splitting mechanism mediated by spin-orbit coupling and breaking of inversion symmetry has been suggested as a possible cause for the reduced recombination rates observed in organohalide perovskites. Here, we investigate the interplay of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom in defining the Rashba splitting in realistic MAPbI3 models. Our simulations disclose a "dynamical Rashba effect", allowing for a quantification of its magnitude under thermal conditions. We find that even in globally centrosymmetric structures the dynamics of the coupled inorganic-organic degrees of freedom give rise to a spatially local Rashba effect which fluctuates on the subpicosecond time scale typical of the methylammonium cation dynamics. This effect is progressively quenched in globally centrosymmetric structures, likely representing the MAPbI3 perovskite at room temperature, on increasing the probed spatial scale up to 32 MAPbI3 units (∼3 nm size) because of the incoherent nuclear thermal motion mediated by the disorder of the organic cations.},

abstract = {The family of organic-inorganic halide perovskite materials has generated tremendous interest in the field of photovoltaics due to their high power conversion efficiencies. There has been intensive development of cells based on the archetypal methylammonium (MA) and recently introduced formamidinium (FA) materials, however, there is still considerable controversy over their fundamental electronic properties. Two of the most important parameters are the binding energy of the exciton (R∗) and its reduced effective mass $\mu$. Here we present extensive magneto optical studies of Cl assisted grown MAPbI3 as well as MAPbBr3 and the FA based materials FAPbI3 and FAPbBr3. We fit the excitonic states as a hydrogenic atom in magnetic field and the Landau levels for free carriers to give R∗ and $\mu$. The values of the exciton binding energy are in the range 14-25 meV in the low temperature phase and fall considerably at higher temperatures for the tri-iodides, consistent with free carrier behaviour in all devices made from these materials. Both R∗ and $\mu$ increase approximately proportionally to the band gap, and the mass values, 0.09-0.117m0, are consistent with a simple k.p perturbation approach to the band structure which can be generalized to predict values for the effective mass and binding energy for other members of this perovskite family of materials.},

abstract = {The conditions necessary in metals for the presence or absence of localized moments on solute ions containing inner shell electrons are analyzed. A self-consistent Hartree-Fock treatment shows that there is a sharp transition between the magnetic state and the nonmagnetic state, depending on the density of states of free electrons, the s-d admixture matrix elements, and the Coulomb correlation integral in the d shell; that in the magnetic state the d polarization can be reduced rather severely to nonintegral values, without appreciable free electron polarization because of a compensation effect; and that in the nonmagnetic state the virtual localized d level tends to lie near the Fermi surface. It is emphasized that the condition for the magnetic state depends on the Coulomb (i.e., exchange self-energy) integral, and that the usual type of exchange alone is not large enough in d-shell ions to allow magnetic moments to be present. We show that the susceptibility and specific heat due to the inner shell electrons show strongly contrasting behavior even in the nonmagnetic state. A calculation including degenerate d orbitals and d-d exchange shows that the orbital angular momentum can be quenched, even when localized spin moments exist, and even on an isolated magnetic atom, by kinetic energy effects.},

abstract = {Despite the relatively simple stoichiometry and structure of VO(2), many questions regarding the nature of its famous metal-insulator transition (MIT) remain unresolved. This is in part due to the prevailing use of polycrystalline film samples and the limited spatial resolution in most studies, hindering access to and control of the complex phase behavior and its inevitable spatial inhomogeneities. Here, we investigate the MIT and associated nanodomain formation in individual VO(2) microcrystals subject to substrate stress. We employ symmetry-selective polarization Raman spectroscopy to identify crystals that are strain-stabilized in either the monoclinic M1 or M2 insulating phase at room-temperature. Raman measurements are further used to characterize the phase dependence on temperature, identifying the appearance of the M2 phase during the MIT. The associated formation and spatial evolution of rutile (R) metallic domains is studied with nanometer-scale spatial resolution using infrared scattering-scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM). We deduce that even for small crystals of VO(2), the MIT is influenced by the competition between the R, M1, and M2 crystal phases with their different lattice constants subjected to the external substrate-induced stress. The results have important implications for the interpretation of the investigations of conventional polycrystalline thin films where the mutual interaction of constituent crystallites may affect the nature of the MIT in VO(2).},

abstract = {The experimental valence band photoemission spectrum of semiconductors exhibits multiple satellites that cannot be described by the GW approximation for the self-energy in the framework of many-body perturbation theory. Taking silicon as a prototypical example, we compare experimental high energy photoemission spectra with GW calculations and analyze the origin of the GW failure. We then propose an approximation to the functional differential equation that determines the exact one-body Green's function, whose solution has an exponential form. This yields a calculated spectrum, including cross sections, secondary electrons, and an estimate for extrinsic and interference effects, in excellent agreement with experiment. Our result can be recast as a dynamical vertex correction beyond GW, giving hints for further developments.},

At temperatures below the Debye temperature nonlocalized small-radius polarons are the cur- rent carriers. The scattering operator for these polarons is singled out and a transport equation is set up by which various kinetic coefficients can be calculated. It is demonstrated that at temperatures exceeding the Debye temperature the main mechanism of motion is classical superbarrier current-carrier jumps from site to site, in which the lattice actively participates. The temperature dependence of the mobility in this case is of an activation nature. The problem of the smallness parameters of the theory is considered. The results obtained are compared with the data of other authors. 1.},

abstract = {Materials engineering is a key for the enhancement of photovoltaics technology. This is particularly true for the novel class of perovskite solar cells. Accurate theoretical modelling can help establish general trends of behavior when addressing structural changes. Here, we consider the effects due to halide substitution in organohalide CH3NH3PbX3 perovskites exploring the halide series with X = Cl, Br, I. For this task, we use accurate DFT and GW methods including spin-orbit coupling. We find the expected band gap increase when moving from X = I to Cl, in line with the experimental data. Most notably, the calculated absorption coefficients for I, Br and Cl are nicely reproducing the behavior reported experimentally. A common feature of all the simulated band structures is a significant Rashba effect. This is similar for MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 while MAPbCl3 shows in general a reduced Rashba interaction coefficient. Finally, a monotonic increase of the exciton reduced masses is calculated when moving from I to Br to Cl, in line with the stronger excitonic character of the lighter perovskite halides.},

abstract = {Strain sensors based on individual ZnO piezoelectric fine-wires (PFWs; nanowires, microwires) have been fabricated by a simple, reliable, and cost-effective technique. The electromechanical sensor device consists of a single electrically connected PFW that is placed on the outer surface of a flexible polystyrene (PS) substrate and bonded at its two ends. The entire device is fully packaged by a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) thin layer. The PFW has Schottky contacts at its two ends but with distinctly different barrier heights. The I- V characteristic is highly sensitive to strain mainly due to the change in Schottky barrier height (SBH), which scales linear with strain. The change in SBH is suggested owing to the strain induced band structure change and piezoelectric effect. The experimental data can be well-described by the thermionic emission-diffusion model. A gauge factor of as high as 1250 has been demonstrated, which is 25{%} higher than the best gauge factor demonstrated for carbon nanotubes. The strain sensor developed here has applications in strain and stress measurements in cell biology, biomedical sciences, MEMS devices, structure monitoring, and more.},

We explore the possibility of a universal bound $D \gtrsim \hbar v_F^2/(k_B T)$ on the underlying diffusion constants in an incoherent metal. Such a bound is loosely motivated by results from holographic duality, the uncertainty principle and from measurements of diffusion in strongly interacting non-metallic systems. Metals close to saturating this bound are shown to have a linear in temperature resistivity with an underlying dissipative timescale matching that recently deduced from experimental data on a wide range of metals. This bound may be responsible for the ubiquitous appearance of high temperature regimes in metals with $T$-linear resistivity, motivating direct probes of diffusive processes and measurements of charge susceptibilities.},

Here, we visualize the Q = 0 (intra-unit-cell) and Q ≠ 0 (density-wave) broken-symmetry states, simultaneously with the coherent k-space topology, for Bi₂Sr₂CaCu₂O(8+$\delta$) samples spanning the phase diagram 0.06 ≤ p ≤ 0.23. We show that the electronic symmetry-breaking tendencies weaken with increasing p and disappear close to a critical doping p(c) = 0.19. Concomitantly, the coherent k-space topology undergoes an abrupt transition, from arcs to closed contours, at the same p(c). These data reveal that the k-space topology transformation in cuprates is linked intimately with the disappearance of the electronic symmetry breaking at a concealed critical point.},

abstract = {The Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a two-dimensional triangular lattice is a paradigmatic problem in frustrated magnetism. Even in the classical limit, its properties are far from simple. The "120 degree" ground state favoured by the frustrated antiferromagnetic interactions contains a hidden chiral symmetry, and supports two distinct types of excitation. And famously, three distinct phases, including a collinear one-third magnetisation plateau, are stabilised by thermal fluctuations in applied magnetic field. The questions of symmetry-breaking raised by this model are deep and subtle, and after more than thirty years of study, many of the details of its phase diagram remain surprisingly obscure. In this paper we use modern Monte Carlo simulation techniques to determine the finite-temperature phase diagram of the classical Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice in applied magnetic field. At low to intermediate values of magnetic field, we find evidence for a continuous phase transition from the paramagnet into the collinear one-third magnetisation plateau, belonging to the three-state Potts universality class. We also find evidence for conventional Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions from the one-third magnetisation plateau into the canted "Y-state", and into the 2:1 canted phase found at high fields. However, the phase transition from the paramagnet into the 2:1 canted phase, while continuous, does not appear to fall into any conventional universality class. We argue that this, like the chiral phase transition discussed in zero field, deserves further study as an interesting example of a finite-temperature phase transition with compound order-parameter symmetry. We comment on the relevance of these results for experiments on magnetic materials with a triangular lattice.},

abstract = {We review the interplay of frustration and strong electronic correlations in quasi-two-dimensional organic charge transfer salts, such as k-(BEDT-TTF)_2X and Et_nMe_{4-n}Pn[Pd(dmit)2]2. These two forces drive a range of exotic phases including spin liquids, valence bond crystals, pseudogapped metals, and unconventional superconductivity. Of particular interest is that in several materials there is a direct transition as a function of pressure from a spin liquid Mott insulating state to a superconducting state. Experiments on these materials raise a number of profound questions about the quantum behaviour of frustrated systems, particularly the intimate connection between spin liquids and superconductivity. Insights into these questions have come from a wide range of theoretical techniques including first principles electronic structure, quantum many-body theory and quantum field theory. In this review we introduce the basic ideas of the field by discussing a simple frustrated Heisenberg model with four spins. We then describe the key experimental results, emphasizing that for two materials, k-(BEDT-TTF)_2Cu_2(CN)_3 and EtMe_3Sb[Pd(dmit)_2]_2, there is strong evidence for a spin liquid ground state, and for EtMe_3P[Pd(dmit)_2]_2, a valence bond solid ground state. We review theoretical attempts to explain these phenomena, arguing that this can be captured by a Hubbard model on the anisotropic triangular lattice at half filling, and that resonating valence bond wavefunctions can capture most of the essential physics. We review evidence that this model can have a spin liquid ground state for a range of parameters that are realistic for the relevant materials. We conclude by summarising the progress made thus far and identifying some of the key questions still to be answered.},

@article{SCHWINGER1949,
abstract = {The covariant formulation of quantum electrodynamics, developed in a previous paper, is here applied to two elementary problems—the polarization of the vacuum and the self-energies of the electron and photon. In the first section the vacuum of the non-interacting electromagnetic and matter fields is covariantly defined as that state for which the eigenvalue of an arbitrary time-like component of the energy-momentum four-vector is an absolute minimum. It is remarked that this definition must be compatible with the requirement that the vacuum expectation values of a physical quantity in various coordinate systems should be, not only covariantly related, but identical, since the vacuum has a significance that is independent of the coordinate system. In order to construct a suitable characterization of the vacuum state vector, a covariant decomposition of the field operators into positive and negative frequency components is introduced, and the properties of these associated fields developed. It is shown that the state vector for the electromagnetic vacuum is annihilated by the positive frequency part of the transverse four-vector potential, while that for the matter vacuum is annihilated by the positive frequency part of the Dirac spinor and of its charge conjugate. These defining properties of the vacuum state vector are employed in the calculation of the vacuum expectation values of quadratic field quantities, specifically the energy-momentum tensors of the independent electromagnetic and matter fields, and the current four-vector. It is inferred that the electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor, and the current vector must vanish in the vacuum, while the matter field energy-momentum tensor vanishes in the vacuum only by the addition of a suitable multiple of the unit tensor. The second section treats the induction of a current in the vacuum by an external electromagnetic field. It is supposed that the latter does not produce actual electron-positron pairs; that is, we consider only the phenomenon of virtual pair creation. This restriction is introduced by requiring that the establishment and subsequent removal of the external field produce no net change in state for the matter field. It is demonstrated, in a general manner, that the induced current at a given space-time point involves the external current in the vicinity of that point, and not the electromagnetic potentials. This gauge invariant result shows that a light wave, propagating at remote distances from its source, induces no current in the vacuum and is therefore undisturbed in its passage through space. The absence of a light quantum self-energy effect is thus indicated. The current induced at a point consists, more precisely, of two parts: a logarithmically divergent multiple of the external current at that point, which produces an unobservable renormalization of charge, and a more involved finite contribution, which is the physically significant induced current. The latter agrees with the results of previous investigations. The modification of the matter field properties arising from interaction with the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field is considered in the third section. The analysis is carried out with two alternative formulations, one employing the complete electromagnetic potential together with a supplementary condition, the other using the transverse potential, with the variables of the supplementary condition eliminated. It is noted that no real processes are produced by the first order coupling between the fields. Accordingly, alternative equations of motion for the state vector are constructed, from which the first order interaction term has been eliminated and replaced by the second order coupling which it generates. The latter includes the self action of individual particles and light quanta, the interaction of different particles, and a coupling between particles and light quanta which produces such effects as Compton scattering and two quantum pair annihilation. It is concluded from a comparison of the alternative procedures that, for the treatment of virtual light quantum processes, the separate consideration of longitudinal and transverse fields is an inadvisable complication. The light quantum self-energy term is shown to vanish, while that for a particle has the anticipated form for a change in proper mass, although the latter is logarithmically divergent, in agreement with previous calculations. To confirm the identification of the self-energy effect with a change in proper mass, it is shown that the result of removing this term from the state vector equation of motion is to alter the matter field equations of motion in the expected manner. It is verified, finally, that the energy and momentum modifications produced by self-interaction effects are entirely accounted for by the addition of the electromagnetic proper mass to the mechanical proper mass—an unobservable mass renormalization. An appendix is devoted to the construction of several invariant functions associated with the electromagnetic and matter fields.},

abstract = {Hybrid perovskites have emerged over the past five years as absorber layers for novel high-efficiency low-cost solar cells combining the advantages of organic and inorganic semiconductors. Unfortunately, electrical transport in these materials is still poorly understood. Employing the linear response approach of density functional theory, we reveal strong anharmonic effects and a double-well phonon instability at the center of the Brillouin zone for both cubic and orthorhombic phases of inorganic CsPbI3. Previously reported soft phonon modes are stabilized at the actual lower-symmetry equilibrium structure, which occurs in a very flat energy landscape, highlighting the strong competition between the different phases of CsPbI3. Factoring these low-energy phonons into electron-phonon interactions and band gap calculations could help better understand the electrical transport properties in these materials. Furthermore, the perovskite oscillations through the corresponding energy barrier could explain the underlying ferroelectricity and the dynamical Rashba effect predicted in halide perovskites for photovoltaics.},

abstract = {This article is an interdisciplinary review of lattice gauge theory and spin systems. It discusses the fundamentals, both physics and formalism, of these related subjects. Spin systems are models of magnetism and phase transitions. Lattice gauge theories are cutoff formulations of gauge theories of strongly interacting particles. Statistical mechanics and field theory are closely related subjects, and the connections between them are developed here by using the transfer matrix. Phase diagrams and critical points of continuous transitions are stressed as the keys to understanding the character and continuum limits of lattice theories. Concepts such as duality, kink condensation, and the existence of a local, relativistic field theory at a critical point of a lattice theory are illustrated in a thorough discussion of the two-dimensional Ising model. Theories with exact local (gauge) symmetries are introduced following Wegner's Ising lattice gauge theory. Its gauge-invariant "loop" correlation function is discussed in detail. Three—dimensional Ising gauge theory is studied thoroughly. The renormalization group of the two dimensional planar model is presented as an illustration of a phase transition driven by the condensation of topological excitations. Parallels are drawn to Abelian lattice gauge theory in four dimensions. Non-Abelian gauge theories are introduced and the possibility of quark confinement is discussed. Asymptotic freedom of O(n) Heisenberg spin systems in two dimensions is verified for n≥ and is explained in simple terms. The direction of present-day research is briefly reviewed.},

abstract = {We study non-Fermi liquid states that arise at the quantum critical points associated with the spin density wave (SDW) and charge density wave (CDW) transitions in metals with twofold rotational symmetry. We use the dimensional regularization scheme, where a one-dimensional Fermi surface is embedded in $3-\epsilon$ dimensional momentum space. In three dimensions, quasilocal marginal Fermi liquids arise both at the SDW and CDW critical points : the speed of the collective mode along the ordering wavevector is logarithmically renormalized to zero compared to that of Fermi velocity. Below three dimensions, however, the SDW and CDW critical points exhibit drastically different behaviors. At the SDW critical point, a stable anisotropic non-Fermi liquid state is realized for small $\epsilon$, where not only time but also different spatial coordinates develop distinct anomalous dimensions. The non-Fermi liquid exhibits an emergent algebraic nesting as the patches of Fermi surface are deformed into a universal power-law shape near the hot spots. Due to the anisotropic scaling, the energy of incoherent spin fluctuations disperse with different power laws in different momentum directions. At the CDW critical point, on the other hand, the perturbative expansion breaks down immediately below three dimensions as the interaction renormalizes the speed of charge fluctuations to zero within a finite renormalization group scale through a two-loop effect. The difference originates from the fact that the vertex correction anti-screens the coupling at the SDW critical point whereas it screens at the CDW critical point.},

@article{Kasahara2012,
abstract = {Electronic nematicity, a unidirectional self-organized state that breaks the rotational symmetry of the underlying lattice, has been observed in the iron pnictide and copper oxide high-temperature superconductors. Whether nematicity plays an equally important role in these two systems is highly controversial. In iron pnictides, the nematicity has usually been associated with the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural transition at temperature T(s). Although recent experiments have provided hints of nematicity, they were performed either in the low-temperature orthorhombic phase or in the tetragonal phase under uniaxial strain, both of which break the 90° rotational C(4) symmetry. Therefore, the question remains open whether the nematicity can exist above T(s) without an external driving force. Here we report magnetic torque measurements of the isovalent-doping system BaFe(2)(As(1-x)P(x))(2), showing that the nematicity develops well above T(s) and, moreover, persists to the non-magnetic superconducting regime, resulting in a phase diagram similar to the pseudogap phase diagram of the copper oxides. By combining these results with synchrotron X-ray measurements, we identify two distinct temperatures-one at T*, signifying a true nematic transition, and the other at T(s) (<T*), which we show not to be a true phase transition, but rather what we refer to as a 'meta-nematic transition', in analogy to the well-known meta-magnetic transition in the theory of magnetism.},

abstract = {To investigate the possibility whether electron-phonon coupling can enhance orbital fluctuations in iron-based superconductors, we develop an ab initio method to construct the effective low-energy models including the phonon-related terms. With the derived effective electron-phonon interactions and phonon frequencies, we estimate the static part (\omega=0) of the phonon-mediated effective on-site intra- or inter-orbital electron-electron attractions as $\sim$ -0.4 eV and exchange or pair-hopping terms as $\sim$ -0.02 eV. We analyze the model with the derived interactions together with the electronic repulsions within the random phase approximation. We find that the enhancement of the orbital fluctuations due to the electron-phonon interactions is small, making the spin fluctuations dominant. As a result, the superconducting state with the sign reversal in gap functions ($s_\pm$-wave) is realized.},

abstract = {In the classic transistor, the number of electric charge carriers--and thus the electrical conductivity--is precisely controlled by external voltage, providing electrical switching capability. This simple but powerful feature is essential for information processing technology, and also provides a platform for fundamental physics research. As the number of charges essentially determines the electronic phase of a condensed-matter system, transistor operation enables reversible and isothermal changes in the system's state, as successfully demonstrated in electric-field-induced ferromagnetism and superconductivity. However, this effect of the electric field is limited to a channel thickness of nanometres or less, owing to the presence of Thomas-Fermi screening. Here we show that this conventional picture does not apply to a class of materials characterized by inherent collective interactions between electrons and the crystal lattice. We prepared metal-insulator-semiconductor field-effect transistors based on vanadium dioxide--a strongly correlated material with a thermally driven, first-order metal-insulator transition well above room temperature--and found that electrostatic charging at a surface drives all the previously localized charge carriers in the bulk material into motion, leading to the emergence of a three-dimensional metallic ground state. This non-local switching of the electronic state is achieved by applying a voltage of only about one volt. In a voltage-sweep measurement, the first-order nature of the metal-insulator transition provides a non-volatile memory effect, which is operable at room temperature. Our results demonstrate a conceptually new field-effect device, extending the concept of electric-field control to macroscopic phase control.},

Researchers have long been interested in manipulating this transition via the field effect. Here we report attempts to modulate this transition in single-crystal VO2 nanowires via electrochemical gating using ionic liquids. Stray water contamination in the ionic liquid leads to large, slow, hysteretic conductance responses to changes in the gate potential, allowing tuning of the activation energy of the conductance in the insulating state. We suggest that these changes are the result of electrochemical doping via hydrogen. In the absence of this chemical effect, gate response is minimal, suggesting that significant field-effect modulation of the metal−insulator transition is not possible, at least along the crystallographic directions relevant in these nanowires.},

Electron density waves have been observed in many families of superconductors, and are often considered to be essential for superconductivity to exist. Recent measurements seem to show that the properties of the iron pnictides are in good agreement with band structure calculations that do not include additional ordering, implying no relation between density waves and superconductivity in these materials. Here we report that the electronic structure of Ba(1-x)K(x)Fe(2)As(2) is in sharp disagreement with those band structure calculations, and instead reveals a reconstruction characterized by a (pi, pi) wavevector.

The electromechanical sensor device consists of a single electrically connected PFW that is placed on the outer surface of a flexible polystyrene (PS) substrate and bonded at its two ends. The entire device is fully packaged by a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) thin layer. The PFW has Schottky contacts at its two ends but with distinctly different barrier heights. The I- V characteristic is highly sensitive to strain mainly due to the change in Schottky barrier height (SBH), which scales linear with strain. The change in SBH is suggested owing to the strain induced band structure change and piezoelectric effect. The experimental data can be well-described by the thermionic emission-diffusion model. A gauge factor of as high as 1250 has been demonstrated, which is 25% higher than the best gauge factor demonstrated for carbon nanotubes. The strain sensor developed here has applications in strain and stress measurements in cell biology, biomedical sciences, MEMS devices, structure monitoring, and more.},

abstract = {{A set of successively more accurate self-consistent equations for the one-electron Green's function have been derived. They correspond to an expansion in a screened potential rather than the bare Coulomb potential. The first equation is adequate for many purposes. Each equation follows from the demand that a corresponding expression for the total energy be stationary with respect to variations in the Green's function. The main information to be obtained, besides the total energy, is one-particle-like excitation spectra, i.e., spectra characterized by the quantum numbers of a single particle. This includes the low-excitation spectra in metals as well as configurations in atoms, molecules, and solids with one electron outside or one electron missing from a closed. -shell structure. In the latter cases we obtain an approximate description by a modified Hartree-Pock equation involving a "Coulomb hole" and a static screened potential in the exchange term. As an example, spectra of some atoms are discussed. To investigate the convergence of successive approximations for the Green's function, extensive calculations have been made for the electron gas at a range of metallic densities. The results are expressed in terms of quasiparticle energies E(k} and quasiparticle interaction. : f(k,k ). The very first approximation gives a good value for the magnitude of E(k). To estimate the derivative of E(k) we need both the first- and the second-order terms. The derivative, and thus the specific heat, is found to diRer from the free-particle value by only a few percent. Our correction to the specific heat keeps the same sign down to the lowest alkali-metal densities, and is smaller than those obtained recently by Silverstein and by Rice. Our results for the paramagnetic susceptibility are unreliable in the alkali-metaldensity region owing to poor convergence of the expansion for f. Besides the proof of a modified Luttinger- Ward-Klein variational principle and a related self-consistency idea, there is not much new in principle in this paper. The emphasis is on the devcloIiment of a numerically manageable approximation scheme.},

abstract = {We establish a direct connection between scattering amplitudes in planar four-dimensional theories and a remarkable mathematical structure known as the positive Grassmannian. The central physical idea is to focus on on-shell diagrams as objects of fundamental importance to scattering amplitudes. We show that the all-loop integrand in N=4 SYM is naturally represented in this way. On-shell diagrams in this theory are intimately tied to a variety of mathematical objects, ranging from a new graphical representation of permutations to a beautiful stratification of the Grassmannian G(k,n) which generalizes the notion of a simplex in projective space. All physically important operations involving on-shell diagrams map to canonical operations on permutations; in particular, BCFW deformations correspond to adjacent transpositions. Each cell of the positive Grassmannian is naturally endowed with positive coordinates and an invariant measure which determines the on-shell function associated with the diagram. This understanding allows us to classify and compute all on-shell diagrams, and give a geometric understanding for all the non-trivial relations among them. Yangian invariance of scattering amplitudes is transparently represented by diffeomorphisms of G(k,n) which preserve the positive structure. Scattering amplitudes in (1+1)-dimensional integrable systems and the ABJM theory in (2+1) dimensions can both be understood as special cases of these ideas. On-shell diagrams in theories with less (or no) supersymmetry are associated with exactly the same structures in the Grassmannian, but with a measure deformed by a factor encoding ultraviolet singularities. The Grassmannian representation of on-shell processes also gives a new understanding of the all-loop integrand for scattering amplitudes, presenting all integrands in a novel dLog form which directly reflects the underlying positive structure.},

abstract = {We consider a general class of approximations which guarantees the conservation of particle number in many-body perturbation theory. To do this we extend the concept of $\Phi$-derivability for the self-energy $\Sigma$ to a larger class of diagrammatic terms in which only some of the Green's function lines contain the fully dressed Green's function $G$. We call the corresponding approximations for $\Sigma$ partially $\Phi$-derivable. A special subclass of such approximations, which are gauge-invariant, is obtained by dressing loops in the diagrammatic expansion of $\Phi$ consistently with $G$. These approximations are number conserving but do not have to fulfill other conservation laws, such as the conservation of energy and momentum. From our formalism we can easily deduce if commonly used approximations will fulfill the continuity equation, which implies particle number conservation. We further show how the concept of partial $\Phi$-derivability plays an important role in the derivation of a generalized sum rule for the particle number, which reduces to the Luttinger-Ward theorem in the case of a homogeneous electron gas, and the Friedel sum rule in the case of the Anderson model. To do this we need to ensure that the Green's function has certain complex analytic properties, which can be guaranteed if the spectral function is positive semi-definite.The latter property can be ensured for a subset of partially $\Phi$-derivable approximations for the self-energy, namely those that can be constructed from squares of so-called half-diagrams. In case the analytic requirements are not fulfilled we highlight a number of subtle issues related to branch cuts, pole structure and multi-valuedness.},

Superconductivity is phonon mediated, but the harmonic approximation largely overestimates the superconducting critical temperatures. We explain the inverse isotope effect, obtaining a −0.38<math display="inline"><mo>-<mn>0.38 value for the isotope coefficient in good agreement with experiments, hydrogen anharmonicity being mainly responsible for the isotope anomaly.},

abstract = {Understanding Dirac-like Fermions has become an imperative in modern condensed matter sciences: all across its research frontier, from graphene to high T{$}{_}c{$} superconductors to the topological insulators and beyond, various electronic systems exhibit properties which can be well described by the Dirac equation. Such physics is no longer the exclusive domain of quantum field theories and other esoteric mathematical musings; instead, real physics of real systems is governed by such equations, and important materials science and practical implications hinge on our understanding of Dirac particles in two and three dimensions. While the physics that gives rise to the massless Dirac Fermions in each of the above mentioned materials is different, the low energy properties are governed by the same Dirac kinematics. The aim of this article is to review a selected cross-section of this vast field by highlighting the generalities, and contrasting the specifics, of several physical systems.},

abstract = {Electron-electron interactions can render an otherwise conducting material insulating, with the insulator-metal phase transition in correlated-electron materials being the canonical macroscopic manifestation of the competition between charge-carrier itinerancy and localization. The transition can arise from underlying microscopic interactions among the charge, lattice, orbital and spin degrees of freedom, the complexity of which leads to multiple phase-transition pathways. For example, in many transition metal oxides, the insulator-metal transition has been achieved with external stimuli, including temperature, light, electric field, mechanical strain or magnetic field. Vanadium dioxide is particularly intriguing because both the lattice and on-site Coulomb repulsion contribute to the insulator-to-metal transition at 340 K (ref. 8). Thus, although the precise microscopic origin of the phase transition remains elusive, vanadium dioxide serves as a testbed for correlated-electron phase-transition dynamics. Here we report the observation of an insulator-metal transition in vanadium dioxide induced by a terahertz electric field. This is achieved using metamaterial-enhanced picosecond, high-field terahertz pulses to reduce the Coulomb-induced potential barrier for carrier transport. A nonlinear metamaterial response is observed through the phase transition, demonstrating that high-field terahertz pulses provide alternative pathways to induce collective electronic and structural rearrangements. The metamaterial resonators play a dual role, providing sub-wavelength field enhancement that locally drives the nonlinear response, and global sensitivity to the local changes, thereby enabling macroscopic observation of the dynamics. This methodology provides a powerful platform to investigate low-energy dynamics in condensed matter and, further, demonstrates that integration of metamaterials with complex matter is a viable pathway to realize functional nonlinear electromagnetic composites.},

Strikingly, coherent interlayer transport strongly reminiscent of superconductivity can be transiently induced up to room temperature (300 kelvin) in YBa2Cu3O6+x (refs 9, 10).

Density functional theory calculations indicate that these motions cause drastic changes in the electronic structure.

abstract = {Present local and semilocal functionals show significant errors, for instance, in the energetics of small molecules and in the description of band gaps. One possible solution to these problems is the introduction of exact exchange and hybrid functionals. A plane-wave-based algorithm was implemented in VASP (Vienna ab-initio simulation package) to allow for the calculation of the exact exchange. To systematically assess the precision of the present implementation, calculations for the 55 molecules of the G2-1 quantum chemical test set were performed applying the PBE and PBE0 functionals. Excellent agreement for both atomization energies and geometries compared with the results obtained by GAUSSIAN 03 calculations using large basis sets (augmented correlation consistent polarized valence quadruple zeta for the geometry optimization and augmented correlation-consistent polarized valence quintuple zeta for the energy calculations) was found. The mean absolute error for atomization energies between VASP and the experiment is 8.6 and 3.7 kcalmol, as calculated with the PBE and PBE0 functionals, respectively. The mean deviations between VASP and GAUSSIAN are 0.46 and 0.49 kcalmol for the PBE and PBE0 functionals, respectively.},

abstract = {I discuss the impact of gauge-gravity duality on our understanding of two classes of systems: conformal quantum matter and compressible quantum matter. The first conformal class includes systems, such as the boson Hubbard model in two spatial dimensions, which display quantum critical points described by conformal field theories. Questions associated with non-zero temperature dynamics and transport are difficult to answer using conventional field theoretic methods. I argue that many of these can be addressed systematically using gauge-gravity duality, and discuss the prospects for reliable computation of low frequency correlations. Compressible quantum matter is characterized by the smooth dependence of the charge density, associated with a global U(1) symmetry, upon a chemical potential. Familiar examples are solids, superfluids, and Fermi liquids, but there are more exotic possibilities involving deconfined phases of gauge fields in the presence of Fermi surfaces. I survey the compressible systems studied using gauge-gravity duality, and discuss their relationship to the condensed matter classification of such states. The gravity methods offer hope of a deeper understanding of exotic and strongly-coupled compressible quantum states.},

By dynamically modifying the potential bias between neighboring lattice sites, the magnitude and sign of the superexchange interaction can be controlled, thus allowing the system to be switched between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic spin interactions. We compare our findings to predictions of a two-site Bose-Hubbard model and find very good agreement, but are also able to identify corrections that can be explained by the inclusion of direct nearest-neighbor interactions.},

abstract = {The GW approximation to the formally exact many-body perturbation theory has been applied successfully to materials for several decades. Since the practical calculations are extremely cumbersome, the GW self-energy is most commonly evaluated using a first-order perturbative approach: This is the so-called G0W0 scheme. However, the G0W0 approximation depends heavily on the mean-field theory that is employed as a basis for the perturbation theory. Recently, a procedure to reach a kind of self-consistency within the GWframework has been proposed. The quasiparticle self-consistent GW (QSGW) approximation retains some positive aspects of a self-consistent approach, but circumvents the intricacies of the complete GW theory, which is inconveniently based on a non-Hermitian and dynamical self-energy. This new scheme allows one to sur- mount most of the flaws of the usual G0W0 at a moderate calculation cost and at a reasonable implementation burden. In particular, the issues of small band gap semiconductors, of large band gap insulators, and of some transition metal oxides are then cured. The QSGW method broadens the range of materials for which the spectral properties can be predicted with confidence},

Within this phase it has been unclear which electronic symmetries (if any) are broken, what the identity of any associated order parameter might be, and which microscopic electronic degrees of freedom are active. Here we report the determination of a quantitative order parameter representing intra-unit-cell nematicity: the breaking of rotational symmetry by the electronic structure within each CuO(2) unit cell. We analyse spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunnelling microscope images of the intra-unit-cell states in underdoped Bi(2)Sr(2)CaCu(2)O(8 +) (delta) and, using two independent evaluation techniques, find evidence for electronic nematicity of the states close to the pseudogap energy. Moreover, we demonstrate directly that these phenomena arise from electronic differences at the two oxygen sites within each unit cell. If the characteristics of the pseudogap seen here and by other techniques all have the same microscopic origin, this phase involves weak magnetic states at the O sites that break 90 degrees -rotational symmetry within every CuO(2) unit cell.},

abstract = {It is pointed out that one of the main effects of correlation phenomena in d- and f-bands is to give rise to behaviour characteristic of the atomic or Heitler-London model. To investigate this situation a simple, approximate model for the interaction of electrons in narrow energy bands is introduced. The results of applying the Hartree-Fock approximation to this model are examined. Using a Green function technique an approximate solution of the correlation problem for this model is obtained. This solution has the property of reducing to the exact atomic solution in the appropriate limit and to the ordinary uncorrelated band picture in the opposite limit. The condition for ferromagnetism of this solution is discussed. To clarify the physical meaning of the solution a two-electron example is examined.},

@article{Feynman1954,
abstract = {It is argued that the wave function representing an excitation in liquid helium should be nearly of the form $\Sigma$if(ri)$\phi$, where $\phi$ is the ground-state wave function, f(r) is some function of position, and the sum is taken over each atom i. In the variational principle this trial function minimizes the energy if f(r)=exp(ik{{\textperiodcentered}}r), the energy value being E(k)=ℏ2k2/2mS(k), where S(k) is the structure factor of the liquid for neutron scattering. For small k, E rises linearly (phonons). For larger k, S(k) has a maximum which makes a ring in the diffraction pattern and a minimum in the E(k) vs k curve. Near the minimum, E(k) behaves as $\Delta$+ℏ2(k-k0)2/2$\mu$, which form Landau found agrees with the data on specific heat. The theoretical value of $\Delta$ is twice too high, however, indicating need of a better trial function. Excitations near the minimum are shown to behave in all essential ways like the rotons postulated by Landau. The thermodynamic and hydrodynamic equations of the two-fluid model are discussed from this view. The view is not adequate to deal with the details of the $\lambda$ transition and with problems of critical flow velocity. In a dilute solution of He3 atoms in He4, the He3 should move essentially as free particles but of higher effective mass. This mass is calculated, in an appendix, to be about six atomic mass units.},

abstract = {We investigate the electron spin relaxation due to the D'yakonov-Perel' and Elliot-Yafet mechanisms, including the intra- and intervalley processes in monolayer MoS2 in the absence of the external electric field. We construct the effective Hamiltonian for the conduction band using the L{\"{o}}wdin partition method from the anisotropic two-band Hamiltonian with the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling of the conduction band included. The spin-orbit coupling of the conduction band induces the intra- and intervalley D'yakonov-Perel' relaxation for in-plane spins. In addition, the Elliot-Yafet spin relaxation also takes place for in-plane spins due to the interband spin mixing. We find that the D'yakonov-Perel' mechanism dominates the in-plane spin relaxation. In the framework of this mechanism, the intravalley process is shown to play a more important role at low temperature, whereas the intervalley one becomes more important at high temperature. At the temperature in between, the leading process of the in-plane spin relaxation changes from the intervalley one to intravalley one as the electron density increases. Moreover, we find that the intravalley process is dominated by the electron-electron Coulomb scattering even with high impurity density since the dominant term in the spin-orbit coupling is isotropic, which does not lead to the spin relaxation together with the electron-impurity scattering. This is very different from previous studies in semiconductors and graphene. In addition to the in-plane spin relaxation, we also study the out-of-plane one in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. The out-of-plane spin relaxation time is found to decrease with the increase of the in-plane magnetic field. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

Use of a helical lattice enables us to break translation invariance while preserving homogeneity. The metallic phase is characterized by a sharp Drude peak and a d.c. resistivity that increases with temperature. In the insulating phase the Drude spectral weight is transferred into a `mid-infrared' peak and to energy scales of order the chemical potential. The d.c. resistivity now decreases with temperature. In the metallic phase, operators breaking translation invariance are irrelevant at low energy scales. In the insulating phase, translation symmetry breaking effects are present at low energies. We find the near horizon extremal geometry that captures the insulating physics.},

abstract = {The role of the electron-phonon (el-ph) interaction in high- Tc cuprates is investigated theoretically by considering correlated electrons interacting with Holstein phonons within the two-dimensional single-band Hubbard model in the limit of large Coulomb interaction. It is shown that the electron-phonon interaction gives rise to a kink in the dispersion along the nodal direction and to a peak/dip/hump structure in the one-electron spectral weight whose dependence on temperature, isotope substitution, and doping is discussed in relation to recent photoemission experiments on the nodal quasiparticles in Bi2201 and LSCO. A comparison with these experiments shows that electron correlations play a crucial role in the determination of the kink position, size, and doping dependence. We also show that the "unusual" oxygen isotope shift in the real part of the self-energy, experimentally observed in the optimally doped Bi2212 samples, can be qualitatively explained within the framework that incorporates both strong electron correlations and the adiabatic electron-phonon interaction. {{\textcopyright}} 2006 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We review the dynamical mean-field theory of strongly correlated electron systems which is based on a mapping of lattice models onto quantum impurity models subject to a self-consistency condition. This mapping is exact for models of correlated electrons in the limit of large lattice coordination (or infinite spatial dimensions). It extends the standard mean-field construction from classical statistical mechanics to quantum problems. We discuss the physical ideas underlying this theory and its mathematical derivation. Various analytic and numerical techniques that have been developed recently in order to analyze and solve the dynamical mean-field equations are reviewed and compared to each other. The method can be used for the determination of phase diagrams (by comparing the stability of various types of long-range order), and the calculation of thermodynamic properties, one-particle Green's functions, and response functions. We review in detail the recent progress in understanding the Hubbard model and the Mott metal-insulator transition within this approach, including some comparison to experiments on three-dimensional transition-metal oxides. We present an overview of the rapidly developing field of applications of this method to other systems. The present limitations of the approach, and possible extensions of the formalism are finally discussed. Computer programs for the numerical implementation of this method are also provided with this article.},

abstract = {The program phon calculates force constant matrices and phonon frequencies in crystals. From the frequencies it also calculates various thermodynamic quantities, like the Helmholtz free energy, the entropy, the specific heat and the internal energy of the harmonic crystal. The procedure is based on the small displacement method, and can be used in combination with any program capable to calculate forces on the atoms of the crystal. In order to examine the usability of the method, I present here two examples: metallic Al and insulating MgO. The phonons of these two materials are calculated using density functional theory. The small displacement method results are compared with those obtained using the linear response method. In the case of Al the method provides accurate phonon frequencies everywhere in the Brillouin Zone (BZ). In the case of MgO the longitudinal branch of the optical phonons near the centre of the BZ is incorrectly described as degenerate with the two transverse branches, because the non-analytical part of the dynamical matrix is ignored here; however, thermodynamic properties like the Helmholtz free are essentially unaffected.

External routines: Subprograms ZHEEV and DSYEV (Lapack); needs BLAS. A tutorial is provided with the distribution which requires the installation of the quantum-espresso package (http://www.quantum-espresso.org). Nature of problem: Stable crystals at low temperature can be well described by expanding the potential energy around the atomic equilibrium positions. The movements of the atoms around their equilibrium positions can then be described using harmonic theory, and is characterised by global vibrations called phonons, which can be identified by vectors in the Brillouin zone of the crystal, and there are 3 phonon branches for each atom in the primitive cell. The problem is to calculate the frequencies of these phonons for any arbitrary choice of q-vector in the Brillouin zone. Solution method: The small displacement method: each atom in the primitive cell is displaced by a small amount, and the forces induced on all the other atoms in the crystal are calculated and used to construct the force constant matrix. Supercells of ∼100 atoms are usually large enough to describe the force constant matrix up to the range where its elements have fallen to negligibly small values. The force constant matrix is then used to compute the dynamical matrix at any chosen q-vector in the Brillouin zone, and the diagonalisation of the dynamical matrix provides the squares of the phonon frequencies. The PHON code needs external programs to calculate these forces, and it can be used with any program capable of calculating forces in crystals. The most useful applications are obtained with codes based on density functional theory, but there is no restriction on what can be used. Running time: Negligible, typically a few seconds (or at most a few minutes) on a PC. It can take longer if very dense meshes of q-points are needed, for example, to compute very accurate phonon density of states. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This article reviews the theory of electron-phonon interactions in solids from the point of view of ab-initio calculations. While the electron-phonon interaction has been studied for almost a century, predictive non-empirical calculations have become feasible only during the past two decades. Today it is possible to calculate from first principles many materials properties related to the electron-phonon interaction, including the critical temperature of conventional superconductors, the carrier mobility in semiconductors, the temperature dependence of optical spectra in direct and indirect-gap semiconductors, the relaxation rates of photoexcited carriers, the electron mass renormalization in angle-resolved photoelectron spectra, and the non-adiabatic corrections to phonon dispersion relations. Here we review the theoretical and computational framework underlying modern electron-phonon calculations from first principles, as well as landmark investigations of the electron-phonon interaction in real materials. In the first part of the article we summarize the elementary theory of electron-phonon interactions and their calculations based on density-functional theory. In the second part we discuss a general field-theoretic formulation of the electron-phonon problem, and establish the connection with practical first-principles calculations. In the third part we review a number of recent investigations of electron-phonon interactions in the areas of vibrational spectroscopy, photoelectron spectoscopy, optical spectroscopy, transport, and superconductivity.},

abstract = {Coupling between electrons and phonons (lattice vibrations) drives the formation of the electron pairs responsible for conventional superconductivity. The lack of direct evidence for electron-phonon coupling in the electron dynamics of the high-transition-temperature superconductors has driven an intensive search for an alternative mechanism. A coupling of an electron with a phonon would result in an abrupt change of its velocity and scattering rate near the phonon energy. Here we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to probe electron dynamics-velocity and scattering rate-for three different families of copper oxide superconductors. We see in all of these materials an abrupt change of electron velocity at 50-80 meV, which we cannot explain by any known process other than to invoke coupling with the phonons associated with the movement of the oxygen atoms. This suggests that electron-phonon coupling strongly influences the electron dynamics in the high-temperature superconductors, and must therefore be included in any microscopic theory of superconductivity.},

In this paper, we perform a variational calculation of the binding energy of the exciton confined in a two-dimensional structure, taking into account the screening of the Coulomb interaction between the electron-hole pair due to the free carriers. The screened potential used is that obtained by Stern and Howard for hydrogenic impurities in semiconducting inversion layers. We find that, although the binding energy of the exciton is reduced because of the presence of screening, the exciton remains bound even for fairly strong screening. This is in contrast to the 3-D case which occurs in bulk semiconductors where the presence of screening can prevent the electron-hole pair from forming an exciton. We have found that the optical absorption at the exciton peak also decreases as the screening increases.},

The empirical relationship between p and c obtained allows calculation of p from the c-axis lattice parameter for the entire doping range of YBCO. It is also suggested that the empirical parabola describing the relationship between Tc and p in La2-dSrdCuO4 is reasonably correct for YBCO except for the region around p =1/8, where the Tc of YBCO is suppressed by as much as 17 K. A correction of the parabola for the p = 1/8 effect is presented.},

Phase-resolved Fourier analysis reveals directly that the modulations in the Ox(r) and Oy(r) sublattice images consistently exhibit a relative phase of $\pi$. We confirm this discovery on two highly distinct cuprate compounds, ruling out tunnel matrix-element and materials-specific systematics. These observations demonstrate by direct sublattice phase-resolved visualization that the density wave found in underdoped cuprates consists of modulations of the intraunit-cell states that exhibit a predominantly d-symmetry form factor.},

abstract = {We argue that extensions of the Standard Model (SM) with a strongly first-order electroweak phase transition generically predict significant deviations of the Higgs couplings to gluons, photons, and Z bosons from their SM values. Precise experimental measurements of the Higgs couplings at the LHC and at the proposed next-generation facilities will allow for a robust test of the phase transition dynamics. To illustrate this point, in this paper we focus on the scenario in which loops of a new scalar field are responsible for the first-order phase transition, and study a selection of benchmark models with various SM gauge quantum numbers of the new scalar. We find that the current LHC measurement of the Higgs coupling to gluons already excludes the possibility of a first-order phase transition induced by a scalar in a sextet, or larger, representation of the SU(3)_c. Future LHC experiments (including HL-LHC) will be able to definitively probe the case when the new scalar is a color triplet. If the new scalar is not colored, an electron-positron Higgs factory, such as the proposed ILC or TLEP, would be required to test the nature of the phase transition. The extremely precise measurement of the Higgsstrahlung cross section possible at such machines will allow for a comprehensive and definitive probe of the possibility of a first-order electroweak phase transition in all models we considered, including the case when the new scalar is a pure gauge singlet.},

Both metallic rutile and insulating low-temperature NbO2, which crystallizes in a distorted rutile structure, are correctly described within density functional theory and the local density approximation. Metallic conductivity is carried by metal t2g orbitals, which fall into the one-dimensional d|| band and the isotropically dispersing e^{$\pi$}_{g} bands. Hybridization of both types of bands is almost negligible outside narrow rods along the line X-R. In the low-temperature phase splitting of the d|| band due to metal-metal dimerization as well as upshift of the e^{$\pi$}_{g} bands due to increased p-d overlap remove the Fermi surface and open an optical band gap of about 0.1 eV. The metal-insulator transition arises as a Peierls instability of the d|| band in an embedding background of e^{$\pi$}^{g} electrons. This basic mechanism should also apply to VO2, where, however, electronic correlations are expected to play a greater role due to stronger localization of the 3d electrons.},

abstract = {In this letter, we study the relaxation of nonequilibrium homogeneous spin distribution due to the D'yakonov-Perel' mechanism in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors with an elliptic band structure. Within the effective-mass approximation, the low-energy band structure is described using anisotropic in-plane effective mass of free carriers. Spin relaxation time of free carriers is calculated theoretically using the time evolution of the density matrix of a polarized spin ensemble in the strong momentum scattering regime. Results are obtained for scattering potential due to both Coulomb interaction and uncharged defects in the sample. We show that the ratio of spin relaxation time in y- and x- directions within the 2D material plane scales as a power of the corresponding effective mass ratio where the exponent depends on the details of the scattering potential. The model is applied to study spin relaxation of electrons in monolayer black phosphorus, which is known to exhibit significant band structure ellipticity. The model can also predict spin relaxation in mechanically strained 2D materials in which elliptic band structure emerges as a consequence of the modification of the lattice constants.},

@article{Wilczek2000,
abstract = {Quantum chromodynamics, familiarly called QCD, is the modern theory of the strong interaction. 1 Historic-ally its roots are in nuclear physics and the description of ordinary matter—understand-ing what protons and neu-trons are and how they inter-act. Nowadays QCD is used to describe most of what goes on at high-energy accelerators. Twenty or even fifteen years ago, this activity was commonly called " testing QCD. " Such is the success of the theory, that we now speak instead of " calculating QCD backgrounds " for the investigation of more speculative phenomena. For example, discovery of the heavy W and Z bosons that mediate the weak interaction, or of the top quark, would have been a much more difficult and uncer-tain affair if one did not have a precise, reliable under-standing of the more common processes governed by QCD. With regard to things still to be found, search strategies for the Higgs particle and for manifestations of supersymmetry depend on detailed understanding of pro-duction mechanisms and backgrounds calculated by means of QCD. Quantum chromodynamics is a precise and beautiful theory. One reflection of this elegance is that the essence of QCD can be portrayed, without severe distortion, in the few simple pictures at the bottom of the box on the next page. But first, for comparison, let me remind you that the essence of quantum electrodynamics (QED), which is a generation older than QCD, can be portrayed by the sin-gle picture at the top of the box, which represents the interaction vertex at which a photon responds to the pres-ence or motion of electric charge. 2 This is not just a metaphor. Quite definite and precise algorithms for calcu-lating physical processes are attached to the Feynman graphs of QED, constructed by connecting just such inter-action vertices. In the same pictorial language, QCD appears as an expanded version of QED. Whereas in QED there is just one kind of charge, QCD has three different kinds of charge, labeled by " color. " Avoiding chauvinism, we might choose red, green, and blue. But, of course, the color charges of QCD have nothing to do with physical colors. Rather, they have properties analogous to electric charge. In particular, the color charges are conserved in all phys-ical processes, and there are photon-like massless parti-cles, called color gluons, that respond in appropriate ways to the presence or motion of color charge, very similar to the way photons respond to electric charge. Quarks and gluons One class of particles that carry color charge are the quarks. We know of six differ-ent kinds, or " flavors, " of quarks—denoted u, d, s, c, b, and t, for: up, down, strange, charmed, bottom, and top. Of these, only u and d quarks play a significant role in the structure of ordinary matter. The other, much heavier quarks are all unstable. A quark of any one of the six flavors can also carry a unit of any of the three color charges. Although the different quark flavors all have different masses, the theory is per-fectly symmetrical with respect to the three colors. This color symmetry is described by the Lie group SU(3). Quarks are spin-1/2 point particles, very much like electrons. But instead of electric charge, they carry color charge. To be more precise, quarks carry fractional elec-tric charge (+ 2e/3 for the u, c, and t quarks, and – e/3 for the d, s, and b quarks) in addition to their color charge. For all their similarities, however, there are a few crucial differences between QCD and QED. First of all, the response of gluons to color charge, as measured by the QCD coupling constant, is much more vigorous than the response of photons to electric charge. Second, as shown in the box, in addition to just responding to color charge, gluons can also change one color charge into another. All possible changes of this kind are allowed, and yet color charge is conserved. So the gluons themselves must be able to carry unbalanced color charges. For example, if absorption of a gluon changes a blue quark into a red quark, then the gluon itself must have carried one unit of red charge and minus one unit of blue charge. All this would seem to require 3 × 3 = 9 different color gluons. But one particular combination of gluons— the color-SU(3) singlet—which responds equally to all charges, is different from the rest. We must remove it if we are to have a perfectly color-symmetric theory. Then we are left with only 8 physical gluon states (forming a color-SU(3) octet). Fortunately, this conclusion is vindicat-ed by experiment! The third difference between QCD and QED, which is the most profound, follows from the second. Because glu-ons respond to the presence and motion of color charge and they carry unbalanced color charge, it follows that gluons, quite unlike photons, respond directly to one another. Photons, of course, are electrically neutral. Therefore the laser sword fights you've seen in Star Wars wouldn't work. But it's a movie about the future, so maybe they're using color gluon lasers.},

While a fully self-consistent GW on top of a hybrid functional approach does correct these wave functions as expected, and is found to be in general agreement with the results of a fully self-consistent GW approach based on semilocal functionals, it is much more computationally demanding as compared to the latter approach for the benefit of essentially the same results.},

abstract = {Effects of the lattice structure on the spin-fluctuation mediated superconductivity is studied theoretically for various iron pnictides. We get a general picture that the gap function and the strength of the superconducting instability are determined by multiple spin fluctuation modes arising from several nestings among disconnected pieces of the Fermi surface, which work constructively or competitively as dictated by the lattice structure. Specifically, the appearance of the Fermi surface around ( $\pi$ , $\pi$ ) in the unfolded Brillouin zone is sensitive to the pnictogen height h Pn above the Fe plane, where h Pn is shown to act as a switch between high- T c nodeless and low- T c nodal pairings.},

abstract = {The role of the electron-phonon (el-ph) interaction in high- Tc cuprates is investigated theoretically by considering correlated electrons interacting with Holstein phonons within the two-dimensional single-band Hubbard model in the limit of large Coulomb interaction. It is shown that the electron-phonon interaction gives rise to a kink in the dispersion along the nodal direction and to a peak/dip/hump structure in the one-electron spectral weight whose dependence on temperature, isotope substitution, and doping is discussed in relation to recent photoemission experiments on the nodal quasiparticles in Bi2201 and LSCO. A comparison with these experiments shows that electron correlations play a crucial role in the determination of the kink position, size, and doping dependence. We also show that the "unusual" oxygen isotope shift in the real part of the self-energy, experimentally observed in the optimally doped Bi2212 samples, can be qualitatively explained within the framework that incorporates both strong electron correlations and the adiabatic electron-phonon interaction. {{\textcopyright}} 2006 The American Physical Society.},

Yet, the resulting evidence is far from being fully conclusive. Herein, we provide another direct support for this issue. In addition to the observation on the conventional band edge at 1.58 eV that presents a blueshift toward temperature increase, interestingly, we also observe an unusual optical band edge at 1.48 eV in CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite single crystals for the first time. Contrary to the conventional band edge, this one shows an obvious redshift toward the enhancement in temperature, in agreement with the Varshni relation. More interestingly, the unusual band edge exhibits a series of obvious absorption and photocurrent signals, but the according photoluminescence signals are not observable. This indicates that this band edge is particularly beneficial for the photovoltaic effect due to the inhibited radiative recombination.

abstract = {Low-temperature magnetic susceptibilities yield an effective magnetic moment per W atom of (3.24+0.10)p& for both WQ Q5VQ 9502 and WQ Q8VQ 9QO2 This value suggests a transfer of two d-shell electrons from the W to neighboring V ions to form V'+-W + and V +-V + pairs along the a axis of the monoclinic low-temperature phase. Studies of the extended x-ray-absorption fine-structure pat- tern for various compositions of different W-cation fraction x, and of the area of the W L&l&-edge resonance as well, confirm that the valence ofW is 6 + . Also, examination of the position of the V E edge versus composition for these alloys and other compounds indicates that the concentration of V + ions increases with W-cation fraction x. Thus, upon alloying VO2 with W, the reduction in the temperature of the metal-semiconductor transition by W appears to be due to charge transfer. From x-ray small-angle scattering it was found that there are no W-atom clusters present. The high-field magnetization at low temperature suggests that alloying causes this oxide to become a spin glass},

abstract = {The pairing mechanism in high-Tc-superconductors (HTS) is still, 13 years after the discovery of HTS, under dispute. However, there are experimental evidences that the electron–phonon (E–P) interaction together with strong electronic correlations plays a decisive role in the formation of the normal state and superconductivity. Tunneling spectroscopy shows clear phonon features in the conductance and together with infrared and Raman optic measurements give strong support for the electron–phonon interaction as the pairing mechanism in HTS oxides. The tunneling experiments show also that almost all phonons contribute to the pairing interaction and the E–P interaction is sufficiently large to produce Tc∼100 K. The strong E–P interaction is due to (a) the layered and almost ionic-metallic structure of HTS oxides; (b) the almost two-dimensional motion of conduction carriers, which give rise to large contribution of the Madelung energy in the E–P interaction, especially for axial phonons.\n\nOn the other hand, a variety of phase-sensitive measurements give support for d-wave pairing in HTS oxides, which has been usually interpreted to be due to the spin-fluctuation mechanism.\n\nWe argue in this review that contrary to low-Tc-superconductors (LTS), where the phonon mechanism leads to s-wave pairing, strong electronic correlations in HTS oxides renormalize the electron–phonon (E–P) interaction, as well as other electron–boson scattering processes related to charge fluctuations, in such a way that the forward scattering peak (FSP) appears, while the backward scattering is suppressed. The FSP mechanism is also supported by the long-range Madelung E–P interaction and the former is pronounced for smaller hole doping $\delta$⪡1.\n\nThe renormalization of the E–P interaction and other charge scattering processes (like impurity scattering) by strong correlations gives rise to (i) a significant (relative) increase of the coupling constant for d-wave pairing $\lambda$d making $\lambda$d≈$\lambda$s for $\delta$≤0.2, where $\lambda$s is the coupling for s-wave pairing. The residual Coulomb repulsion between quasiparticles (or the interaction via spin fluctuations, which is peaked in the “backward” scattering at Q≈($\pi$, $\pi$)) triggers the system to d-wave pairing, while Tc is dominantly due to the E–P interaction; (ii) a reduction (with respect to the pairing coupling constant $\lambda$) of the transport E–P coupling constant $\lambda$tr(≲$\lambda$/3), i.e. to the quenching of the resistivity $\rho$(T) where $\rho$∼$\lambda$trT for T>$\Theta$D/5; (iii) a suppression of the residual quasiparticle scattering on nonmagnetic impurities; (iv) robustness of d-wave pairing in the presence of nonmagnetic impurities and (v) nonadiabatic corrections to the E–P interaction and accordingly to a possible increase of Tc in systems with $\omega$D≲EF.\n\nFurthermore, the development of the forward scattering peak in the E–P interaction of the optimally hole-doped HTS oxides gives rise, besides the d-wave superconductivity, also to (a) the small isotope effect; and (b) the strong temperature dependence of the gap anisotropy.\n\nIn the overdoped oxides the FSP mechanism and spin fluctuations are suppressed which leads to (a) anisotropic s-wave pairing with moderate gap anisotropy, and (b) an increase of the isotope effect.},

@article{Balzar1993,
abstract = {A method to analyze powder-diffraction line broadening is proposed and applied to some novel high-T(c) superconductors. Assuming that both size-broadened and strain-broadened profiles of the pure-specimen profile are described with a Voigt function, it is shown that the analysis of Fourier coefficients leads to the Warren-Averbach method of separation of size and strain contributions. The analysis of size coefficients shows that the ''hook'' effect occurs when the Cauchy content of the size-broadened profile is underestimated. The ratio of volume-weighted and surface-weighted domain sizes can change from approximately 1.31 for the minimum allowed Cauchy content to 2 when the size-broadened profile is given solely by a Cauchy function. If the distortion coefficient is approximated by a harmonic term, mean-square strains decrease linearly with the increase of the averaging distance. The local strain is finite only in the case of pure-Gauss strain broadening because strains are then independent of averaging distance. Errors of root-mean-square strains as well as domain sizes were evaluated. The method was applied to two cubic structures with average volume-weighted domain sizes up to 3600 angstrom as well as to tetragonal and orthorhombic (La-Sr)2CuO4, which exhibit weak line broadenings and highly overlapping reflections. Comparison with the integral-breadth methods is given. Reliability of the method is discussed in the case of a cluster of the overlapping peaks. The analysis of La2CuO4 and La1.85M0.15CuO4(M=Ca, Ba, Sr) high-T(c) superconductors showed that microstrains and incoherently diffracting domain sizes are highly anisotropic. In the superconductors, stacking-fault probability increases with increasing T(c); microstrain decreases. In La2CuO4, different broadening of (h00) and (0k0) reflections is not caused by stacking faults; it might arise from lower crystallographic symmetry. The analysis of Bi-Cu-O superconductors showed much higher strains in the [001] direction than in the basal a-b plane. This may be caused by stacking disorder along the c-axis, because of the two-dimensional weakly bonded BiO double layers. Results for the specimen containing two related high-T(c) phases indicate a possible mechanism for the phase transformation by the growth of faulted regions of the major phase.},

abstract = {This article presents a systematic theoretical enquiry concerning the conceptual foundations and the nature of phonon-mediated electron-electron interactions. Starting from the fundamental many-body Hamiltonian, we propose a simple scheme to decouple the electrons and nuclei of a crystalline solid via effective interactions. These effective interactions, which we express in terms of linear response functions, are completely symmetric between electrons and nuclei. Correspondingly, we derive concrete formulae for both the effective electron interaction mediated by phonons and the effective nuclear interaction mediated by electrons. In particular, we rederive from our fundamental ansatz the well-known general expressions of the effective electron-electron interaction in terms of the elastic Green function and the phonon dispersion relation. We further show that the effective nuclear interaction coincides in the instantaneous limit with the dynamical matrix as calculated in electronic structure theory. If combined with the Kubo formalism, our general formulae lend themselves to the calculation of effective interactions from first principles. By showing the compatibility of our approach with the functional integral formalism, this work also paves the way for the derivation of ab initio initial interactions for functional renormalization group applications.},

A plateau was detected in the stress-strain curve, signifying superelasticity of the nanowire arising from the M1-M2 structural phase transition. The transition was induced and controlled by uniaxial tension. The transition dynamics were characterized by a one-dimensionally aligned domain structure with pinning and depinning of the domain walls along the nanowire. From the stress-strain dependence the Young's moduli of the VO(2) M1 and M2 phases were estimated to be 128 ± 10 and 156 ± 10 GPa, respectively. Single pinning and depinning events of M1-M2 domain wall were observed in the superelastic regime, allowing for evaluation of the domain wall pinning potential energy. This study demonstrates a new way to investigate nanoscale mechanics and dynamics of structural phase transitions in general.},

The Ti-doping is known as the most effective method to reduce $\Delta$Tc and has been considered as the prototypical model in understanding the mechanism by which the $\Delta$Tc of VO2 MST could be manipulated. Here we present a joint experimental and first-principles computational study on non- doped and Ti-doped VO2 to clarify the mechanism of Ti-doping on narrowing the hysteresis loop width of VO2. On the basis of the analyses of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), we found that phase transition temperatures in the cooling circle increase faster than those in the heating circle with increasing Ti concentrations, exhibiting a hysteresis width reduction at 2 °C per Ti at. %. First-principles calculations reveal that dopant Ti atoms break the octahedral symmetry of local structure in VO2 (R) phase. This distortion is propagated in anisotropy and exhibits an obvious nonlocal effect. In contrast, the Ti-doping-induced structural change in VO2 (M) phase is only constrained in Ti-involved chain along the a-axis. The calculated energy profiles for TixV1−xO2 phase transition shows that structural stability and activation energies increased with the increase of Ti concentration. The activation barriers in Ti-doped VO2 (R) phases are increased more remarkably than that in Ti-doped VO2 (M) phases, which is consistent with experimental observation of concentration-dependent reduction of thermal hysteresis width.},

abstract = {The free field theories that we've discussed so far are very special: we can determine their spectrum, but nothing interesting then happens. They have particle excitations, but these particles don't interact with each other. Here we'll start to examine more complicated theories that include interaction terms. These will take the form of higher order terms in the Lagrangian. We'll start by asking what kind of small perturbations we can add to the theory. For example, consider the Lagrangian for a real scalar field, L = 1 2 ∂ µ $\phi$ ∂ µ $\phi$ − 1 2 m 2 $\phi$ 2 − n≥3 $\lambda$ n n! $\phi$ n (3.1) The coefficients $\lambda$ n are called coupling constants. What restrictions do we have on $\lambda$ n to ensure that the additional terms are small perturbations? You might think that we need simply make " $\lambda$ n ≪ 1 " . But this isn't quite right. To see why this is the case, let's do some dimensional analysis. Firstly, note that the action has dimensions of angular momentum or, equivalently, the same dimensions as Since we've set = 1, using the convention described in the introduction, we have [S] = 0. With S = d 4 x L, and [d 4 x] = −4, the Lagrangian density must therefore have [L] = 4 (3.2) What does this mean for the Lagrangian (3.1)? Since [∂ µ ] = 1, we can read off the mass dimensions of all the factors to find, [$\phi$] = 1 , [m] = 1 , [$\lambda$ n ] = 4 − n (3.3) So now we see why we can't simply say we need $\lambda$ n ≪ 1, because this statement only makes sense for dimensionless quantities. The various terms, parameterized by $\lambda$ n , fall into three different categories • [$\lambda$ 3 ] = 1: For this term, the dimensionless parameter is $\lambda$ 3 /E, where E has dimensions of mass. Typically in quantum field theory, E is the energy scale of the process of interest. This means that $\lambda$ 3 $\phi$ 3 /3! is a small perturbation at high energies E ≫ $\lambda$ 3 , but a large perturbation at low energies E ≪ $\lambda$ 3 . Terms that we add to the Lagrangian with this behavior are called relevant because they're most relevant at low energies (which, after all, is where most of the physics we see lies). In a relativistic theory, E > m, so we can always make this perturbation small by taking $\lambda$ 3 ≪ m. – 47 –},

abstract = {Twistor theory offers a new approach, starting with conformally-invariant concepts, to the synthesis of quantum theory and relativity. Twistors for flat space-time are the SU(2,2) spinors of the twofold covering group O(2,4) of the conformal group. They describe the momentum and angular momentum structre of zero-rest-mass particles. Space-time points arise as secondary concepts corresponding to linear sets in twistor space. They, rather than the null cones, should become “smeared out” on passage to a quantised gravitational theory. Twistors are represented here in two-component spinor terms. Zero-rest-mass fields are described by holomorphic functions on twistor space, on which there is a natural canonical structure leading to a natural choice of canonical quantum operators. The generalisation to curved space can be accomplished in three ways; i) local twistors, a conformally invariant calculus, ii) global twistors, and iii) asymptotic twistors which provide the framework for an S-matrix approach in asymptotically flat space-times. A Hamiltonian scattering theory of global twistors is used to calculate scattering cross-sections. This leads to twistor analogues of Feynman graphs for the treatment of massless quantum electrodynamics. The recent development of methods for dealing with massive (conformal symmetry breaking) sources and fields is briefly reviewed.},

E.P.R. and resistivity measurements indicate a decrease in the metallic character of the high-temperature R phase with increasing x, and calorimetric measurements of the energetics of the transition show a decrease in the enthalpy and entropy of the transition with increasing levels of doping. This concomitant decrease in enthalpy and metallic character with increasing x implies a strong contribution of the electronic entropy to the transition. An extrapolation of the combined electronic and calorimetric data for GaxV-xO2 to pure VO2 suggest that the electronic entropy comprises about 60% of the total entropy of transition in VO2. ?? 1978.},

@article{Tselev2010,
abstract = {The ability to synthesize VO2 in the form of single-crystalline nanobeams and nano- and microcrystals uncovered a number of previously unknown aspects of the metal-insulator transition (MIT) in this oxide. In particular, several reports demonstrated that the MIT can proceed through competition between two monoclinic (insulating) phases M1 and M2 and the tetragonal (metallic) R phase under influence of strain. The nature of such phase behavior has been not identified. Here we show that the competition between M1 and M2 phases is purely lattice-symmetry-driven. Within the framework of the Ginzburg-Landau formalism, both M phases correspond to different directions of the same four-component structural order parameter, and as a consequence, the M2 phase can appear under a small perturbation of the M1 structure such as doping or stress. We analyze the strain-controlled phase diagram of VO2 in the vicinity of the R-M2-M1 triple point using the Ginzburg-Landau formalism and identify and experimentally verify the pathways for strain-control of the transition. These insights open the door toward more systematic approaches to synthesis of VO2 nanostructures in desired phase states and to use of external fields in the control of the VO2 phase states. Additionally, we report observation of the triclinic T phase at the heterophase domain boundaries in strained quasi-two-dimensional VO2 nanoplatelets, and theoretically predict phases that have not been previously observed.},

abstract = {The role of the electron-phonon (el-ph) interaction in high- Tc cuprates is investigated theoretically by considering correlated electrons interacting with Holstein phonons within the two-dimensional single-band Hubbard model in the limit of large Coulomb interaction. It is shown that the electron-phonon interaction gives rise to a kink in the dispersion along the nodal direction and to a peak/dip/hump structure in the one-electron spectral weight whose dependence on temperature, isotope substitution, and doping is discussed in relation to recent photoemission experiments on the nodal quasiparticles in Bi2201 and LSCO. A comparison with these experiments shows that electron correlations play a crucial role in the determination of the kink position, size, and doping dependence. We also show that the "unusual" oxygen isotope shift in the real part of the self-energy, experimentally observed in the optimally doped Bi2212 samples, can be qualitatively explained within the framework that incorporates both strong electron correlations and the adiabatic electron-phonon interaction. {{{\textcopyright}}} 2006 The American Physical Society.},

Light absorption (including excitonic effects) has been studied extensively using first-principles calculations, but methods for computing radiative recombination and light emission are still being developed. Here we show a unified ab initio approach to compute exciton radiative recombination in materials ranging from bulk crystals to nanostructures and molecules. We derive the rate of exciton radiative recombination in bulk crystals, isolated systems, and in one- and two-dimensional materials, using Fermi's golden rule within the Bethe-Salpeter equation approach. We present benchmark calculations of radiative lifetimes in a GaAs crystal and in gas-phase organic molecules. Our work provides a general method for studying exciton recombination and light emission in bulk, nanostructured and molecular materials from first principles.},

In sharp distinction to particle physics applications, the anticommuting variables here do not correspond to half-integer spin physical degrees of freedom in the system but rather were first introduced as an elegant technical trick for handling certain combinatoric and averaging problems. Despite his primarily technical role, supersymmetry has provided considerable insight, including a novel geometrical perspective, into several areas of condensed matter physics, including random magnetic fields in Ising-like models, branched and linear polymers, and electron localization in disordered media. We present and discuss examples from each of these areas.},

It is shown that the elements of this matrix can be calculated, by a consistent use of perturbation theory, to any desired order in the fine-structure constant.

abstract = {The Green's function method has applications in several fields in Physics, from classical differential equations to quantum many-body problems. In the quantum context, Green's functions are correlation functions, from which it is possible to extract information from the system under study, such as the density of states, relaxation times and response functions. Despite its power and versatility, it is known as a laborious and sometimes cumbersome method. Here we introduce the equilibrium Green's functions and the equation-of-motion technique, exemplifying the method in discrete lattices of non-interacting electrons. We start with simple models, such as the two-site molecule, the infinite and semi-infinite one-dimensional chains, and the two-dimensional ladder. Numerical implementations are developed via the recursive Green's function, implemented in Julia, an open-source, efficient and easy-to-learn scientific language. We also present a new variation of the surface recursive Green's function method, which can be of interest when simulating simultaneously the properties of surface and bulk.},

The first three sections give a relatively short review of basic renormalization group ideas, mainly in the context of critical phenomena. The relationship of the modern renormalization group to the older problems of divergences in statistical mechanics and field theory and field theoretic renormalization is discussed in Sec. IV. In Sec. V the special case of "marginal variables" is discussed in detail, along with the relationship of the modern renormalization group to its original formulation by Gell-Mann and Low and others.},

Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. We use this potential for a self-consistent calculation of the ground state properties of a number of van der Waals complexes as well as crystalline silicon. For the latter, where little or no van der Waals interaction is expected, we find that the results are mostly determined by semilocal exchange and correlation as in standard generalized gradient approximations (GGA), with the fully nonlocal term giving little effect. On the other hand, our results for the van der Waals complexes show that the self-consistency has little effect at equilibrium separations. This finding validates previous calculations with the same functional that treated the fully nonlocal term as a post GGA perturbation. A comparison of our results with wave-function calculations demonstrates the usefulness of our approach. The exchange-correlation potential also allows us to calculate Hellmann-Feynman forces, hence providing the means for efficient geometry relaxations as well as unleashing the potential use of other standard techniques that depend on the self-consistent charge distribution. The nature of the van der Waals bond is discussed in terms of the self-consistent bonding charge.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Gell-Mann and Zweig posited that they were not elementary particles, but were instead composed of combinations of quarks and antiquarks. Their model involved three flavors of quarks – up, down, and strange – to which they ascribed properties such as spin and electric charge.[19][20][21] The initial reaction of the physics community to the proposal was mixed. There was particular contention about whether the quark was a physical entity or an abstraction used to explain concepts that were not properly understood at the time.},

In the cuprate high-temperature superconductor YBa(2)Cu(3)O(y) (YBCO), application of a magnetic field to suppress superconductivity reveals a ground state that appears to break the translational symmetry of the lattice, pointing to some density-wave order. Here we use a comparative study of thermoelectric transport in the cuprates YBCO and La(1.8-x)Eu(0.2)Sr(x)CuO(4) (Eu-LSCO) to show that the two materials exhibit the same process of Fermi-surface reconstruction as a function of temperature and doping. The fact that in Eu-LSCO this reconstruction coexists with spin and charge modulations that break translational symmetry shows that stripe order is the generic non-superconducting ground state of hole-doped cuprates.},

abstract = {The modern formulation of the renormalization group is explained for both critical phenomena in classical statistical mechanics and quantum field theory. The expansion in ϵ = 4−d is explained [d is the dimension of space (statistical mechanics) or space-time (quantum field theory)]. The emphasis is on principles, not particular applications. Sections 1–8 provide a self-contained introduction at a fairly elementary level to the statistical mechanical theory. No background is required except for some prior experience with diagrams. In particular, a diagrammatic approximation to an exact renormalization group equation is presented in sections 4 and 5; sections 6–8 include the approximate renormalization group recursion formula and the Feyman graph method for calculating exponents. Sections 10–13 go deeper into renormalization group theory (section 9 presents a calculation of anomalous dimensions). The equivalence of quantum field theory and classical statistical mechanics near the critical point is established in section 10; sections 11–13 concern problems common to both subjects. Specific field theoretic references assume some background in quantum field theory. An exact renormalization group equation is presented in section 11; sections 12 and 13 concern fundamental topological questions.},

Further measurements demonstrate that this compound exhibits metallic conduction and Pauli paramagnetism from room temperature down to 2 K. From density functional theory calculations it is revealed that MgFeGe favors the same antiferromagnetic ground state magnetic configuration as LiFeAs. Moreover, considerable resemblance in the band dispersion, density of state, and Fermi surface was confirmed between MgFeGe and its isoelectronic superconducting counterpart LiFeAs. The results, however, suggest that the presence of the basic structural and electronic features of iron-based superconductors in MgFeGe does not necessarily lead to superconductivity, and further investigation is therefore still deserved to understand the related mechanisms.},

Phase-resolved Fourier analysis reveals directly that the modulations in the Ox(r) and Oy(r) sublattice images consistently exhibit a relative phase of $\pi$. We confirm this discovery on two highly distinct cuprate compounds, ruling out tunnel matrix-element and materials-specific systematics. These observations demonstrate by direct sublattice phase-resolved visualization that the density wave found in underdoped cuprates consists of modulations of the intraunit-cell states that exhibit a predominantly d-symmetry form factor.},

@article{SCHWINGER1949,
abstract = {The covariant formulation of quantum electrodynamics, developed in a previous paper, is here applied to two elementary problems—the polarization of the vacuum and the self-energies of the electron and photon. In the first section the vacuum of the non-interacting electromagnetic and matter fields is covariantly defined as that state for which the eigenvalue of an arbitrary time-like component of the energy-momentum four-vector is an absolute minimum. It is remarked that this definition must be compatible with the requirement that the vacuum expectation values of a physical quantity in various coordinate systems should be, not only covariantly related, but identical, since the vacuum has a significance that is independent of the coordinate system. In order to construct a suitable characterization of the vacuum state vector, a covariant decomposition of the field operators into positive and negative frequency components is introduced, and the properties of these associated fields developed. It is shown that the state vector for the electromagnetic vacuum is annihilated by the positive frequency part of the transverse four-vector potential, while that for the matter vacuum is annihilated by the positive frequency part of the Dirac spinor and of its charge conjugate. These defining properties of the vacuum state vector are employed in the calculation of the vacuum expectation values of quadratic field quantities, specifically the energy-momentum tensors of the independent electromagnetic and matter fields, and the current four-vector. It is inferred that the electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor, and the current vector must vanish in the vacuum, while the matter field energy-momentum tensor vanishes in the vacuum only by the addition of a suitable multiple of the unit tensor. The second section treats the induction of a current in the vacuum by an external electromagnetic field. It is supposed that the latter does not produce actual electron-positron pairs; that is, we consider only the phenomenon of virtual pair creation. This restriction is introduced by requiring that the establishment and subsequent removal of the external field produce no net change in state for the matter field. It is demonstrated, in a general manner, that the induced current at a given space-time point involves the external current in the vicinity of that point, and not the electromagnetic potentials. This gauge invariant result shows that a light wave, propagating at remote distances from its source, induces no current in the vacuum and is therefore undisturbed in its passage through space. The absence of a light quantum self-energy effect is thus indicated. The current induced at a point consists, more precisely, of two parts: a logarithmically divergent multiple of the external current at that point, which produces an unobservable renormalization of charge, and a more involved finite contribution, which is the physically significant induced current. The latter agrees with the results of previous investigations. The modification of the matter field properties arising from interaction with the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field is considered in the third section. The analysis is carried out with two alternative formulations, one employing the complete electromagnetic potential together with a supplementary condition, the other using the transverse potential, with the variables of the supplementary condition eliminated. It is noted that no real processes are produced by the first order coupling between the fields. Accordingly, alternative equations of motion for the state vector are constructed, from which the first order interaction term has been eliminated and replaced by the second order coupling which it generates. The latter includes the self action of individual particles and light quanta, the interaction of different particles, and a coupling between particles and light quanta which produces such effects as Compton scattering and two quantum pair annihilation. It is concluded from a comparison of the alternative procedures that, for the treatment of virtual light quantum processes, the separate consideration of longitudinal and transverse fields is an inadvisable complication. The light quantum self-energy term is shown to vanish, while that for a particle has the anticipated form for a change in proper mass, although the latter is logarithmically divergent, in agreement with previous calculations. To confirm the identification of the self-energy effect with a change in proper mass, it is shown that the result of removing this term from the state vector equation of motion is to alter the matter field equations of motion in the expected manner. It is verified, finally, that the energy and momentum modifications produced by self-interaction effects are entirely accounted for by the addition of the electromagnetic proper mass to the mechanical proper mass—an unobservable mass renormalization. An appendix is devoted to the construction of several invariant functions associated with the electromagnetic and matter fields.},

abstract = {By using first-principles calculations, we propose that WC-type ZrTe is a new type of topological semimetal (TSM). It has six pairs of chiral Weyl nodes in its first Brillouin zone, but it is distinguished from other existing TSMs by having an additional two Paris of massless fermions with triply degenerate nodal points as proposed in the isostructural compounds TaN and NbN. The mirror symmetry, threefold rotational symmetry, and time-reversal symmetry require all of the Weyl nodes to have the same velocity vectors and locate at the same energy level. The Fermi arcs on different surfaces are shown, which may be measured by future experiments. It demonstrates that the "material universe" can support more intriguing particles simultaneously.},

This is in conjugation with the observation of ARPES that shows almost the same electron and hole Fermi surfaces (FSs) size for undoped and Cu substituted LiFeAs sample, except for a very small hole band sinking below Fermi level with doping. This indicates that there is little doping effect at Fermi surface by Cu substitution, in sharp contrast to the more effective carrier doping effect by Ni or Co.},

abstract = {We present new recursion relations for tree amplitudes in gauge theory that give very compact formulas. Our relations give any tree amplitude as a sum over terms constructed from products of two amplitudes of fewer particles multiplied by a Feynman propagator. The two amplitudes in each term are physical, in the sense that all particles are on-shell and momentum conservation is preserved. This is striking, since it is just like adding certain factorization limits of the original amplitude to build up the full answer. As examples, we recompute all known tree-level amplitudes of up to seven gluons and show that our recursion relations naturally give their most compact forms. We give a new result for an eight-gluon amplitude, A (1+, 2-, 3+, 4-, 5+, 6-, 7+, 8-). We show how to build any amplitude in terms of three-gluon amplitudes only. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

An approximation is proposed which limits all the calculations to counting certain types of configurations and attaching the proper weights. The expectation values of the one-particle and two-particle density matrix are computed for the ferromagnetic and for the non-ferromagnetic case. The ground-state energy is obtained under the assumption that only the intra-atomic Coulomb interaction is of importance. Ferromagnetism is found to occur if the density of states is large at the band edges rather than in the center, and if the intra-atomic Coulomb repulsion is sufficiently strong. The relation of this approximation to certain exact results for one-dimensional models is discussed.},

These wavefunctions, which go by such names as matrix product states and tensor network states, occupy a different region of Hilbert space from wavefunctions built around the Hartree–Fock limit. The best known class of low entanglement wavefunctions, the matrix product states, forms the variational space of the density matrix renormalization group algo- rithm. Because of their different structure to many other quantum chemistry wavefunctions, low entanglement approximations hold promise for problems conventionally considered hard in quantum chemistry, and in particular prob- lems which have a multireference or strong correlation nature. In this review, we describe low entanglement wavefunctions at an introductory level, focus- ing on the main theoretical ideas. Topics covered include the theory of effi- cient wavefunction approximations, entanglement, matrix product states, and tensor network states including the tree tensor network, projected entangled pair states, and themultiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz.},

We observe no significant statistical difference in their overall performance, although the screened hybrid HSE is more accurate for typical semiconductors. HSE can improve its accuracy for large band gap materials - without affecting that of semiconductors - by including a larger portion of Hartree-Fock exchange in its short-range. Given that screened hybrids are computationally much less expensive than their global counterparts, we conclude that they are a better option for the black box prediction of band gaps.},

abstract = {Based on the s-d interaction model for dilute magnetic alloys we have calculated the scattering probability of the conduction electrons to the second Born approximation. Because of the dynamical character of the localized spin system, the Pauli principle should be taken into account in the intermediate states of the second order terms. Thus the effect of the Fermi sphere is involved in the scattering probability and gives rise to a singular term in the resistivity which involves c log T as a factor, where c is the concentration of impurity atoms. When combined with the lattice resistivity, this gives rise to a resistance minimum, provided the s-d exchange integral J is negative. The temperature at which the minimum ccurs is proportional to c1/5 and the depth of the minimum to c, as is observed. The predicted log T dependence is tested with available experiments and is confirmed. The value of J to have fit with experiments is about -0.2 ev, which is of reasonable magnitude. Our conclusion is that J should be negative in alloys which show a resistance minimum. It is argued that the resistance minimum is a result of the sharp Fermi surface.},

abstract = {The characterization of a material as metallic or insulating, the study of transitions between such states, and the development of models for such transitions is of great fundamental and practical interest. The one-band Hubbard model is potentially relevant in this context since its primary parameter, the on-site interaction, triggers a transition or a crossover from metallic to insulating behavior at half filling. A reduction of complexity is achieved by the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT); due to its nonperturbative character, this method is reliable in the range of interest, i.e., for intermediate to strong coupling. It becomes exact in the limit of high dimensionality (or large coordination number). This work focuses on strongly correlated electron systems near a Mott metal-insulator transition. In the pedagogical chapter 1, we introduce the general electronic Hamiltonian and its reduction to the Hubbard model. We characterize the DMFT and its relation with mean-field approximations to spin systems and present the mean-field equations as well as their numerical solution using the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method. Finally, we discuss the analytic continuation of imaginary-time Green functions by the maximum entropy method (MEM). In chapter 2, we study the relations between lattice types, frustration, and densities of states (DOS). On the basis of Monte Carlo computations of momentum sums, we also evaluate the convergence of the DOS to its infinite-dimensional (d = ∞) limit. We present new insights on the “Bethe lattice” and on the impact of longer-range hopping for this model. A new formalism is developed that allows to construct models with hypercubic symmetry which reproduce an arbitrary target DOS in d = ∞. Using this approach, we can for the first time define a regular lattice with semi-elliptic DOS in d = ∞. In the central chapter 3, we thoroughly explore the low-temperature properties of the fully frustrated Hubbard model with semi-elliptic DOS within the DMFT. The boundaries of a coexistence region of metallic and insulating solutions are determined with high accuracy, thereby resolving a controversy on the existence of a first-order transition within this model. We correct deficiencies in previously used QMC schemes and formulate an improved criterion for the detection of phase transitions. Going beyond previous work, the first-order transition line is accurately determined using a newly developed formalism. Finally, we suggest further methodological improvements and compute local MEM spectra with high precision. Transport properties are discussed in chapter 4, where we review and extend the relevant formalisms. We derive new expressions for the optical f-sum rule in d = ∞. Fully lattice specific calculations of the optical conductivity are shown to be essential; errors made in earlier studies of frustration are quantified. We point out the ambiguities associated with any DMFT calculation of transport properties for “the Bethe lattice” and review possible concepts for making the problem well-defined; the regular lattice defined in chapter 2 is seen to have the most desirable properties. We then present accurate numerical results for the optical conductivity which are based on the MEM spectra computed in chapter 3. The thesis closes with chapter 5, where we review the density functional theory and its local density approximation (LDA) and introduce the recently developed hybrid LDA+DMFT scheme. We discuss the solution using QMC as well as the extraction of photoemission and X-ray absorption spectra. Numerical results for the doped transition metal oxide La1-xSrxTiO3 with controlled precision are compared with experiments. Finally, a definition of the optical conductivity compatible with the LDA DOS is derived using the formalism developed in chapter 2; corresponding numerical results on the basis of MEM spectra are presented.},

Sethna's book takes this step for statistical mechanics-a field rooted in physics and chemistry whose ideas and methods are now central to information theory, complexity, and modern biology. Aimed at advanced undergraduates and early graduate students in all of these fields, Sethna limits his main presentation to the topics that future mathematicians and biologists, as well as physicists and chemists, will find fascinating and central to their work. The amazing breadth of the field is reflected in the author's large supply of carefully crafted exercises, each an introduction to a whole field of study: everything from chaos through information theory to life at the end of the universe.},

abstract = {We propose a form for the exchange-correlation potential in local-density band theory, appropriate for Mott insulators. The idea is to use the "constrained-local-density-approximation" Hubbard parameter U as the quantity relating the single-particle potentials to the magnetic- (and orbital-) order parameters. Our energy functional is that of the local-density approximation plus the mean-field approximation to the remaining part of the U term. We argue that such a method should make sense, if one accepts the Hubbard model and the success of constrained-local-density-approximation parameter calculations. Using this ab initio scheme, we find that all late-3d-transition-metal monoxides, as well as the parent compounds of the high-T, compounds, are large-gap magnetic insulators of the charge-transfer type. Further, the method predicts that LiNiO2 is a low-spin ferromagnet and NiS a local-moment p-type metal. The present version of the scheme fails for the early-3d-transition-metal monoxides and for the late 3d transition metals.},

The linearized Eliashberg equation is solved by expanding the effective pairing interaction perturbatively up to third order in the on-site Coulomb integrals. The numerical results for the 5-band model suggest that the eigenvalues of the Eliashberg equation are sufficiently large to explain the actual high Tc for realistic values of Coulomb interaction and the most probable pairing state is spin-singlet s-wave without any nodes just on the Fermi surfaces, although the superconducting order parameter changes its sign between the small Fermi pockets. On the other hand the 2-band model is quite insufficient to explain the actual high Tc.},

Further measurements demonstrate that this compound exhibits metallic conduction and Pauli paramagnetism from room temperature down to 2 K. From density functional theory calculations it is revealed that MgFeGe favors the same antiferromagnetic ground state magnetic configuration as LiFeAs. Moreover, considerable resemblance in the band dispersion, density of state, and Fermi surface was confirmed between MgFeGe and its isoelectronic superconducting counterpart LiFeAs. The results, however, suggest that the presence of the basic structural and electronic features of iron-based superconductors in MgFeGe does not necessarily lead to superconductivity, and further investigation is therefore still deserved to understand the related mechanisms.},

(ii) The use of general yet powerful criteria for the truncation of infinite sums; in particular, the Coulomb electron-electron interactions are subdivided into terms corresponding to intersecting or nonintersecting charge distributions; the latter are grouped into shell contributions and the interaction is evaluated by multipolar expansions; the exchange interaction may be evaluated with great precision by retaining a relatively small number of two-electron integrals according to a truncation criterion which fully preserves its nonlocal character. (iii) The use of a procedure for performing integrals over k, as needed in the evaluation of the Fermi energy and in the reconstruction of the Fock matrix, which is particularly simple because it employs partially intersecting small spheres as integration subdomains where linear extrapolation is admitted. A comparison is finally made of our fundamental equations in the critical SCF stage with those obtainable by a recent proposal which uses Fourier transforms to express Coulomb and exchange integrals.},

Within this scenario, the spin-fluctuations play a decisive role in formation of the fermionic excitation spectrum in the normal state and are sufficient to explain the high transition temperatures to the superconducting state while the pseudogap phenomenon is a consequence of a Peierls-type intrinsic instability of electronic system to formation of an incommensurate density wave.

In materials that have significant localized and itinerant spins, it is not obvious which will induce order. We combine electrical transport, X-ray magnetic diffraction, and photoemission studies with band structure calculations to characterize successive antiferromagnetic transitions in GdSi. GdSi has both sizable local moments and a partially nested Fermi surface, without confounding contributions from orbital effects. We identify a route to incommensurate order where neither type of moment dominates, but is rooted in cooperative feedback between them. The nested Fermi surface of the itinerant electrons induces strong interactions between local moments at the nesting vector, whereas the ordered local moments in turn provide the necessary coupling for a spin-density wave to form among the itinerant electrons. This mechanism echoes the cooperative interactions between electrons and ions in charge-density-wave materials, and should be germane across a spectrum of transition-metal and rare-earth intermetallic compounds.},

We demonstrate herein, using ab initio computations, a new trend suggesting that the cuprates with stronger out-of-CuO2-plane chemical bonding between the apical anion (O, Cl) and apical cation (e.g., La, Hg, Bi, Tl) are generally correlated with higher Tc,max in experiments. We then show the underlying fundamental phenomena of coupled apical charge flux and lattice dynamics when the apical oxygen oscillates vertically. This triggers the charge flux among the apical cation, apical anion, and the in-plane CuO4 unit. The effect not only dynamically modulates the site energy of the hole at a given Cu site to control the in-plane charge transfer energy, but also can modulate the in-plane hole hopping integral simultaneously in a dynamic way by the cooperative apical charge fluxes.},

We build up the subject from basic quantum field theory, starting with Feynman rules for simple processes in Yukawa theory and QED. The material covered includes spinor helicity formalism, on-shell recursion relations, superamplitudes and their symmetries, twistors and momentum twistors, loops and integrands, Grassmannians, polytopes, and amplitudes in perturbative supergravity as well as 3d Chern-Simons-matter theories. Multiple examples and exercises are included.},

abstract = {The Luttinger-Ward functional $\Phi[\mathbf{G}]$, which expresses the thermodynamic grand potential in terms of the interacting single-particle Green's function $\mathbf{G}$, is found to be ill-defined for fermionic models with the Hubbard on-site interaction. In particular, we show that the self-energy $\mathbf{\Sigma}[\mathbf{G}] \propto \delta\Phi[\mathbf{G}]/\delta\mathbf{G}$ is \textit{not} a single-valued functional of $\mathbf{G}$: in addition to the physical solution for $\mathbf{\Sigma}[\mathbf{G}]$, there exists at least one qualitatively distinct unphysical branch. This result is demonstrated for several models: the Hubbard atom, the Anderson impurity model, and the full two-dimensional Hubbard model. Despite this pathology, the skeleton Feynman diagrammatic series for $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ in terms of $\mathbf{G}$ is found to converge at least for moderately low temperatures. However, at strong interactions, its convergence is to the unphysical branch. This reveals a new scenario of breaking down of diagrammatic expansions. In contrast, the bare series in terms of the non-interacting Green's function $\mathbf{G}_0$ converges to the correct physical branch of $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ in all cases currently accessible by diagrammatic Monte Carlo. Besides their conceptual importance, these observations have important implications for techniques based on the explicit summation of diagrammatic series.},

The model effectiveness is demonstrated on a ZnO powder pattern exhibiting strongly anisotropic size broadening and pronounced super-Lorentzian peak shapes. Moreover, it is shown how the apparent crystallites can be interpreted in terms of physical models by using ellipsoidal and cylindrical crystallites with lognormal size distributions. This interpretation is critically assessed and it is argued that both simplified physical models and a priori complementary information (obtained by transmission electron microscopy, for instance) are often needed to avoid unstable and non-unique solutions.},

abstract = {The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of V" has been studied in the series of compounds V, „Cr„02 between 100 and 350 K. Three insulating phases are clearly distinguished. In the low-temperature M, phase only one V site is seen with a positive Knight shift and electric-field gradient identical to the insulating phase of pure VO,. At temperatures just below the metal-insulator transition a second phase M, is stable in which two sites are resolved. One site has a small positive Knight-shift characteristic of a paired V'+ site while the other has a negative Knight shift showing a localized V'+ site. These two sites are identified as the V atoms on the paired chains and the equispaced chains in C2/m structure of Marezio et al. At intermediate temperatures a transitional phase T is stable in which two sites can be resolved by their electric-field gradients. The two sites are progressively differentiated by increasing temperature and Cr concentration and are interpreted as arising from two sets of inequivalent paired chains, one of which is depairing with increasing temperature and Cr concentration. These results are inconsistent with the monoclinic symmetry and a disordered bond model proposed previously for the transitional phase. Triclinic splittings were observed recently by Villeneuve et al. and additional crystallographic evidence supporting this result is presented. The magnetic properties are interpreted as a set of noninteracting linear Heisenberg chains and the M,-T transition as a dimerization of the linear Heisenberg chain. The results demonstrate a breakdown of the band model in the insulating phases.},

abstract = {The stability of nonrelativistic fermionic systems to interactions is studied within the Renormalization Group framework. A brief introduction to $\phi^4$ theory in four dimensions and the path integral formulation for fermions is given. The strategy is as follows. First, the modes on either side of the Fermi surface within a cut-off $\Lambda$ are chosen and a path integral is written to describe them. An RG transformation which eliminates a part of these modes, but preserves the action of the noninteracting system is identified. Finally the possible perturbations of this free-field fixed point are classified as relevant, irrelevant or marginal. A $d=1$ warmup calculation involving a system of fermions shows how, in contrast to mean-field theory, the RG correctly yields a scale invariant system (Luttinger liquid) In $d=2$ and 3, for rotationally invariant Fermi surfaces, {\em automatically} leads to Landau's Fermi liquid theory, which appears as a fixed point characterized by an effective mass and a Landau function $F$, with the only relevant perturbations being of the superconducting (BCS) type The functional flow equations for the BCS couplings are derived and separated into an infinite number of flows, one for each angular momentum. It is shown that similar results hold for rotationally non-invariant (but time-reversal invariant) Fermi surfaces also, A study of a nested Fermi surface shows an additional relevant flow leading to charge density wave formation. For small $\Lambda/ K_F$, a 1/N expansion emerges, with $N = K_F/ \Lambda$, which explains why one is able to solve the narrow cut-off theory. The search for non-Fermi liquids in $d=2$},

abstract = {The abrupt first-order metal-insulator phase transition in single-crystal vanadium dioxide nanowires (NWs) is engineered to be a gradual transition by axially grading the doping level of tungsten. We also demonstrate the potential of these NWs for thermal sensing and actuation applications. At room temperature, the graded-doped NWs show metal phase on the tips and insulator phase near the center of the NW, and the metal phase grows progressively toward the center when the temperature rises. As such, each individual NW acts as a microthermometer that can be simply read out with an optical microscope. The NW resistance decreases gradually with the temperature rise, eventually reaching 2 orders of magnitude drop, in stark contrast to the abrupt resistance change in undoped VO2 wires. This novel phase transition yields an extremely high temperature coefficient of resistivity {$\sim$}10{%}/K, simultaneously with a very low resistivity down to 0.001 $\Omega${\textperiodcentered}cm, making these NWs promising infrared sensing materials for uncooled microbolometers. Lastly, they form bimorph thermal actuators that bend with an unusually high curvature, {$\sim$}900 m(-1){\textperiodcentered}K(-1) over a wide temperature range (35-80 °C), significantly broadening the response temperature range of previous VO2 bimorph actuators. Given that the phase transition responds to a diverse range of stimuli-heat, electric current, strain, focused light, and electric field-the graded-doped NWs may find wide applications in thermo-opto-electro-mechanical sensing and energy conversion.},

Through an analysis of density functional calculations we determine the nature of magnetic interactions for transition metals doped ZnO and develop a physical picture based on hybridization, superexchange, and double exchange that captures chemical trends. We identify a crucial role of defects in the observed weak and preparation sensitive ferromagnetism in ZnO:Mn and ZnO:Co. We predict and explain co-doping of Li and Zn interstitials to both yield ferromagnetism in ZnO:Co, in contrast with earlier insights, and verify it experimentally.},

A clear IE shift in T c was observed. Moreover, we found that the IE coefficient alpha exhibits an unusual variation with T c . For lower-T c crystals containing impurities and defects, $\alpha$ is positive and increases with decreasing T c ; $\alpha$(T c ) is described well by the universal behavior expected theoretically. However, for crystals with T c approaching T c0 , $\alpha$ deviates from the universal $\alpha$(T c ) and becomes negative.

Several widespread theoretical approaches are used in an attempt to determine the most appropriate approach which would reproduce the experimental electronic structure and optical properties of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite. We compare a semilocal approximation to the density functional theory with hybrid functionals and time-dependent hybrid functional calculations, evaluating the effects of exchange tuning and spin-orbit coupling. Using these methods we calculate the electronic structure, optical absorption spectrum, and frequency-dependent dielectric function of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite. The results are compared to the experimentally obtained dielectric functions acquired from ellipsometry measurements. We demonstrate that inclusion of spin-orbit coupling in theoretical calculations is critical in describing the electronic and optical properties of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite. Good agreement with experimental data is achieved when the optical spectra are computed using time-dependent hybrid density functional theory with spin-orbit coupling.},

The model contains bosonic dimers, representing a spin-singlet valence bond between a pair of electrons, and fermionic dimers, representing a quasiparticle with spin-$1/2$ and charge $+e$. By density matrix renormalization group calculations on a long but finite cylinder, we obtain the ground state density distribution of the fermionic dimers for a number of different total densities. From the Friedel oscillations at open boundaries, we deduce that the Fermi surface consists of small hole pockets near $(\pi/2, \pi/2)$, and this feature persists up to doping density $1/16$. We also compute the entanglement entropy and find that it closely matches the sum of the entanglement entropies of a critical boson and a low density of free fermions. Our results support the existence of a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) in this model.},

Here we use a comparative study of thermoelectric transport in the cuprates YBCO and La(1.8-x)Eu(0.2)Sr(x)CuO(4) (Eu-LSCO) to show that the two materials exhibit the same process of Fermi-surface reconstruction as a function of temperature and doping. The fact that in Eu-LSCO this reconstruction coexists with spin and charge modulations that break translational symmetry shows that stripe order is the generic non-superconducting ground state of hole-doped cuprates.},

abstract = {Despite the relatively simple stoichiometry and structure of VO(2), many questions regarding the nature of its famous metal-insulator transition (MIT) remain unresolved. This is in part due to the prevailing use of polycrystalline film samples and the limited spatial resolution in most studies, hindering access to and control of the complex phase behavior and its inevitable spatial inhomogeneities. Here, we investigate the MIT and associated nanodomain formation in individual VO(2) microcrystals subject to substrate stress. We employ symmetry-selective polarization Raman spectroscopy to identify crystals that are strain-stabilized in either the monoclinic M1 or M2 insulating phase at room-temperature. Raman measurements are further used to characterize the phase dependence on temperature, identifying the appearance of the M2 phase during the MIT. The associated formation and spatial evolution of rutile (R) metallic domains is studied with nanometer-scale spatial resolution using infrared scattering-scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM). We deduce that even for small crystals of VO(2), the MIT is influenced by the competition between the R, M1, and M2 crystal phases with their different lattice constants subjected to the external substrate-induced stress. The results have important implications for the interpretation of the investigations of conventional polycrystalline thin films where the mutual interaction of constituent crystallites may affect the nature of the MIT in VO(2).},

abstract = {Vanadium dioxide (VO2) is a strongly correlated transition metal oxide with a dramatic metal−insulator transition at 67 °C. Researchers have long been interested in manipulating this transition via the field effect. Here we report attempts to modulate this transition in single-crystal VO2 nanowires via electrochemical gating using ionic liquids. Stray water contamination in the ionic liquid leads to large, slow, hysteretic conductance responses to changes in the gate potential, allowing tuning of the activation energy of the conductance in the insulating state. We suggest that these changes are the result of electrochemical doping via hydrogen. In the absence of this chemical effect, gate response is minimal, suggesting that significant field-effect modulation of the metal−insulator transition is not possible, at least along the crystallographic directions relevant in these nanowires.},

The lack of direct evidence for electron-phonon coupling in the electron dynamics of the high-transition-temperature superconductors has driven an intensive search for an alternative mechanism. A coupling of an electron with a phonon would result in an abrupt change of its velocity and scattering rate near the phonon energy. Here we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to probe electron dynamics-velocity and scattering rate-for three different families of copper oxide superconductors. We see in all of these materials an abrupt change of electron velocity at 50-80 meV, which we cannot explain by any known process other than to invoke coupling with the phonons associated with the movement of the oxygen atoms. This suggests that electron-phonon coupling strongly influences the electron dynamics in the high-temperature superconductors, and must therefore be included in any microscopic theory of superconductivity.},

abstract = {In symmetry-broken crystalline solids, pole structures of Berry curvature (BC) can emerge, and they have been utilized as a versatile tool for controlling transport properties. For example, the monopole component of the BC is induced by the time-reversal symmetry breaking, and the BC dipole arises from a lack of inversion symmetry, leading to the anomalous Hall and nonlinear Hall effects, respectively. Based on first-principles calculations, we show that the ferroelectricity in a tin telluride monolayer produces a unique BC distribution, which offers charge- and spin-controllable photocurrents. Even with the sizable band gap, the ferroelectrically driven BC dipole is comparable to those of small-gap topological materials. By manipulating the photon handedness and the ferroelectric polarization, charge and spin circular photogalvanic currents are generated in a controllable manner. The ferroelectricity in group-IV monochalcogenide monolayers can be a useful tool to control the BC dipole and the nonlinear optoelectronic responses.},

Most of our understanding of many-body systems comes from analyzing the symmetry properties of Hamiltonian and states: the most striking example are gauge theories such as quantum electrodynamics, where a local symmetry strongly constrains the microscopic dynamics. The physics of such gauge theories is relevant for the understanding of a diverse set of systems, including frustrated quantum magnets and the collective dynamics of elementary particles within the standard model. In the last few years, several approaches have been put forward to tackle the complex dynamics of gauge theories using quantum information concepts. In particular, quantum simulation platforms have been put forward for the realization of synthetic gauge theories, and novel classical simulation algorithms based on quantum information concepts have been formulated. In this review we present an introduction to these approaches, illustrating the basics concepts and highlighting the connections between apparently very different fields, and report the recent developments in this new thriving field of research.},

Their insulating character and structural distortions are often ascribed to dynamical electronic correlations within a universal, symmetry-conserving paradigm. This view restricts predictive theory to complex computational schemes, going beyond density functional theory (DFT). Here, we show that, if one allows symmetry-breaking energy-lowering crystal symmetry reductions and electronic instabilities within DFT, one successfully and systematically recovers the trends in the observed band gaps, magnetic moments, type of magnetic and crystallographic ground state, bond disproportionation and ligand hole effects, Mott vs. charge transfer insulator behaviors, and the amplitude of structural deformation modes including Jahn-Teller in low temperature spin-ordered and high temperature disordered paramagnetic phases. We then provide a classification of the four mechanisms of gap formation and establish DFT as a reliable base platform to study the ground state properties in complex oxides.},

The idea is to use the "constrained-local-density-approximation" Hubbard parameter U as the quantity relating the single-particle potentials to the magnetic- (and orbital-) order parameters. Our energy functional is that of the local-density approximation plus the mean-field approximation to the remaining part of the U term. We argue that such a method should make sense, if one accepts the Hubbard model and the success of constrained-local-density-approximation parameter calculations. Using this ab initio scheme, we find that all late-3d-transition-metal monoxides, as well as the parent compounds of the high-T, compounds, are large-gap magnetic insulators of the charge-transfer type. Further, the method predicts that LiNiO2 is a low-spin ferromagnet and NiS a local-moment p-type metal. The present version of the scheme fails for the early-3d-transition-metal monoxides and for the late 3d transition metals.},

abstract = {Nonlinear optical excitation of infrared active lattice vibrations has been shown to melt magnetic or orbital orders and to transform insulators into metals. In cuprates, this technique has been used to remove charge stripes and promote superconductivity, acting in a way opposite to static magnetic fields. Here, we show that excitation of large-amplitude apical oxygen distortions in the cuprate superconductor YBa2 Cu3 O6.5 promotes highly unconventional electronic properties. Below the superconducting transition temperature (Tc = 50 K) inter-bilayer coherence is transiently enhanced at the expense of intra-bilayer coupling. Strikingly, even above T c a qualitatively similar effect is observed up to room temperature, with transient inter-bilayer coherence emerging from the incoherent ground state and similar transfer of spectral weight from high to low frequency. These observations are compatible with previous reports of an inhomogeneous normal state that retains important properties of a superconductor, in which light may be melting competing orders or dynamically synchronizing the interlayer phase. The transient redistribution of coherence discussed here could lead to new strategies to enhance superconductivity in steady state. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

It is still unclear whether the high-Tc superconductivity can be universally associated with the pseudogap formation. Here we provide direct evidence of the existence of the pseudogap phase via angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in another family of high-Tc superconductor, iron-pnictides. Our results reveal a composition dependent pseudogap formation in the multi-band electronic structure of BaFe2(As1-xPx)2. The pseudogap develops well above the magnetostructural transition for low x, persists above the nonmagnetic superconducting dome for optimal x and is destroyed for x $\sim$ 0.6, thus showing a notable similarity with cuprates. In addition, the pseudogap formation is accompanied by inequivalent energy shifts in xz/yz orbitals of iron atoms, indicative of a peculiar iron orbital ordering which breaks the four-fold rotational symmetry.},

@article{Wilson1974,
abstract = {The modern formulation of the renormalization group is explained for both critical phenomena in classical statistical mechanics and quantum field theory. The expansion in ϵ = 4−d is explained [d is the dimension of space (statistical mechanics) or space-time (quantum field theory)]. The emphasis is on principles, not particular applications. Sections 1–8 provide a self-contained introduction at a fairly elementary level to the statistical mechanical theory. No background is required except for some prior experience with diagrams. In particular, a diagrammatic approximation to an exact renormalization group equation is presented in sections 4 and 5; sections 6–8 include the approximate renormalization group recursion formula and the Feyman graph method for calculating exponents. Sections 10–13 go deeper into renormalization group theory (section 9 presents a calculation of anomalous dimensions). The equivalence of quantum field theory and classical statistical mechanics near the critical point is established in section 10; sections 11–13 concern problems common to both subjects. Specific field theoretic references assume some background in quantum field theory. An exact renormalization group equation is presented in section 11; sections 12 and 13 concern fundamental topological questions.},

abstract = {Close to optimal doping, the copper oxide superconductors show 'strange metal' behaviour, suggestive of strong fluctuations associated with a quantum critical point. Such a critical point requires a line of classical phase transitions terminating at zero temperature near optimal doping inside the superconducting 'dome'. The underdoped region of the temperature-doping phase diagram from which superconductivity emerges is referred to as the 'pseudogap' because evidence exists for partial gapping of the conduction electrons, but so far there is no compelling thermodynamic evidence as to whether the pseudogap is a distinct phase or a continuous evolution of physical properties on cooling. Here we report that the pseudogap in YBa2Cu3O6+$\delta$ is a distinct phase, bounded by a line of phase transitions. The doping dependence of this line is such that it terminates at zero temperature inside the superconducting dome. From this we conclude that quantum criticality drives the strange metallic behaviour and therefore superconductivity in the copper oxide superconductors.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {{\AA}} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{Jackson2001,
abstract = {Gauge invariance is the basis of the modern theory of electroweak and strong interactions (the so called Standard Model). The roots of gauge invariance go back to the year 1820 when electromagnetism was discovered and the first electrodynamic theory was proposed. Subsequent developments led to the discovery that different forms of the vector potential result in the same observable forces. The partial arbitrariness of the vector potential A brought forth various restrictions on it. div A = 0 was proposed by J. C. Maxwell; 4-div A = 0 was proposed L. V. Lorenz in the middle of 1860's . In most of the modern texts the latter condition is attributed to H. A. Lorentz, who half a century later was one of the key figures in the final formulation of classical electrodynamics. In 1926 a relativistic quantum-mechanical equation for charged spinless particles was formulated by E. Schrodinger, O. Klein, and V. Fock. The latter discovered that this equation is invariant with respect to multiplication of the wave function by a phase factor exp(ieX/hc) with the accompanying additions to the scalar potential of -dX/cdt and to the vector potential of grad X. In 1929 H. Weyl proclaimed this invariance as a general principle and called it Eichinvarianz in German and gauge invariance in English. The present era of non-abelian gauge theories started in 1954 with the paper by C. N. Yang and R. L. Mills.},

abstract = {The recent discovery of superconductivity in the iron oxypnictide family of compounds has generated intense interest. The layered crystal structure with transition-metal ions in planar square-lattice form and the discovery of spin-density-wave order near 130 K (refs 10, 11) seem to hint at a strong similarity with the copper oxide superconductors. An important current issue is the nature of the ground state of the parent compounds. Two distinct classes of theories, distinguished by the underlying band structure, have been put forward: a local-moment antiferromagnetic ground state in the strong-coupling approach, and an itinerant ground state in the weak-coupling approach. The first approach stresses on-site correlations, proximity to a Mott-insulating state and, thus, the resemblance to the high-transition-temperature copper oxides, whereas the second approach emphasizes the itinerant-electron physics and the interplay between the competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic fluctuations. The debate over the two approaches is partly due to the lack of conclusive experimental information on the electronic structures. Here we report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) of LaOFeP (superconducting transition temperature, T(c) = 5.9 K), the first-reported iron-based superconductor. Our results favour the itinerant ground state, albeit with band renormalization. In addition, our data reveal important differences between these and copper-based superconductors.},

abstract = {Kamihara and coworkers' report of superconductivity at Tc = 26 K in fluorine-doped LaFeAsO inspired a worldwide effort to understand the nature of the superconductivity in this new class of compounds. These iron pnictide and chalcogenide (FePn/Ch) superconductors have Fe electrons at the Fermi surface, plus an unusual Fermiology that can change rapidly with doping, which lead to normal and superconducting state properties very different from those in standard electron-phonon coupled 'conventional' superconductors. Clearly superconductivity and magnetism/magnetic fluctuations are intimately related in the FePn/Ch - and even coexist in some. Open questions, including the superconducting nodal structure in a number of compounds, abound and are often dependent on improved sample quality for their solution. With Tc values up to 56 K, the six distinct Fe-containing superconducting structures exhibit complex but often comparable behaviors. The search for correlations and explanations in this fascinating field of research would benefit from an organization of the large, seemingly disparate data set. This review attempts to provide an overview, using numerous references, with a focus on the materials and their superconductivity.},

@article{Zhu2015,
abstract = {The concept of a charge density wave (CDW) permeates much of condensed matter physics and chemistry. CDWs have their origin rooted in the instability of a one-dimensional system described by Peierls. The extension of this concept to reduced dimensional systems has led to the concept of Fermi surface nesting (FSN), which dictates the wave vector [Formula: see text] of the CDW and the corresponding lattice distortion. The idea is that segments of the Fermi contours are connected by [Formula: see text], resulting in the effective screening of phonons inducing Kohn anomalies in their dispersion at [Formula: see text], driving a lattice restructuring at low temperatures. There is growing theoretical and experimental evidence that this picture fails in many real systems and in fact it is the momentum dependence of the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) matrix element that determines the characteristic of the CDW phase. Based on the published results for the prototypical CDW system 2H-NbSe2, we show how well the [Formula: see text]-dependent EPC matrix element, but not the FSN, can describe the origin of the CDW. We further demonstrate a procedure of combing electronic band and phonon measurements to extract the EPC matrix element, allowing the electronic states involved in the EPC to be identified. Thus, we show that a large EPC does not necessarily induce the CDW phase, with Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+$\delta$ as the example, and the charge-ordered phenomena observed in various cuprates are not driven by FSN or EPC. To experimentally resolve the microscopic picture of EPC will lead to a fundamental change in the way we think about, write about, and classify charge density waves.},

After preparing a spin-mixture of ultracold atoms in an antiferromagnetically ordered state, we measured coherent superexchange-mediated spin dynamics with coupling energies from 5 hertz up to 1 kilohertz. By dynamically modifying the potential bias between neighboring lattice sites, the magnitude and sign of the superexchange interaction can be controlled, thus allowing the system to be switched between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic spin interactions. We compare our findings to predictions of a two-site Bose-Hubbard model and find very good agreement, but are also able to identify corrections that can be explained by the inclusion of direct nearest-neighbor interactions.},

@article{Holstein1959,
abstract = {In this paper is described a model for polaron motion which incorporates, in simplified form, the principal physical features of the problem. The (crystalline) medium, within which a single excess electron (or hole) is contained, is taken to be a one-dimensional molecular crystal, consisting of diatomic molecular sites; each site possesses a single vibrational degree of freedom, represented by the deviation, xn, of its internuclear separation from equilibrium. The motion of the electron in this medium is treated by a tight-binding approach, in which the wave function is represented as a superposition of local "molecular" functions, $\phi$(r - na, xn). In line with the xn dependence of the $\delta$'s, it is also assumed that the "local" electronic energy, En, (which, in the conventional tight-binding theory, has one and the same value for all sites) depends (linearly) on xn. This dependence gives rise to electron-lattice interaction; alternatively, it may be regarded as removing the electronic translational degeneracy, characteristic of the undistorted crystal, and thereby providing the possibility for electron trapping. On the basis of the above-described model, the zeroth order adiabatic treatment of the polaron problem is developed. For values of the parameters such that the linear dimension of the polaron is large compared to a lattice spacing ("large" polaron), an exact solution is obtained; the correspondence between it and Pekar's zeroth-order solution is established. The conditions under which the size of the polaron becomes comparable to a lattice spacing ("small" polaron) are discussed. Finally, by way of exhibiting the relationship of the molecular-crystal concept to the real situation, a description is given of an alternate molecular-crystal model which, in the case of the large polaron, is completely equivalent to the continuum-polarization model of conventional polaron theory. {\textcopyright} 1959.},

First, the modes on either side of the Fermi surface within a cut-off {$}\backslashLambda{\$} are chosen and a path integral is written to describe them. An RG transformation which eliminates a part of these modes, but preserves the action of the noninteracting system is identified. Finally the possible perturbations of this free-field fixed point are classified as relevant, irrelevant or marginal.

Here we report an experimental study of a condensed-matter system (graphene, a single atomic layer of carbon) in which electron transport is essentially governed by Dirac's (relativistic) equation. The charge carriers in graphene mimic relativistic particles with zero rest mass and have an effective 'speed of light' c* approximately 10(6) m s(-1). Our study reveals a variety of unusual phenomena that are characteristic of two-dimensional Dirac fermions. In particular we have observed the following: first, graphene's conductivity never falls below a minimum value corresponding to the quantum unit of conductance, even when concentrations of charge carriers tend to zero; second, the integer quantum Hall effect in graphene is anomalous in that it occurs at half-integer filling factors; and third, the cyclotron mass m(c) of massless carriers in graphene is described by E = m(c)c*2. This two-dimensional system is not only interesting in itself but also allows access to the subtle and rich physics of quantum electrodynamics in a bench-top experiment.},

abstract = {The nature of the pseudogap in high transition temperature (high-Tc) superconducting cuprates has been a major issue in condensed matter physics. It is still unclear whether the high-Tc superconductivity can be universally associated with the pseudogap formation. Here we provide direct evidence of the existence of the pseudogap phase via angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in another family of high-Tc superconductor, iron-pnictides. Our results reveal a composition dependent pseudogap formation in the multi-band electronic structure of BaFe2(As1-xPx)2. The pseudogap develops well above the magnetostructural transition for low x, persists above the nonmagnetic superconducting dome for optimal x and is destroyed for x $\sim$ 0.6, thus showing a notable similarity with cuprates. In addition, the pseudogap formation is accompanied by inequivalent energy shifts in xz/yz orbitals of iron atoms, indicative of a peculiar iron orbital ordering which breaks the four-fold rotational symmetry.},

abstract = {Vanadium dioxide VO(2) and its metal-insulator transition at T = 340 K continue to receive considerable interest. The question whether the physics of the insulating low-temperature phase is dominated by the Mott or the Peierls scenario, i.e. by correlation or band effects, is still under debate. A recent cluster dynamical mean field theory calculation (Biermann et al 2005 Phys. Rev. Lett. 94 026404) suggests a combination of both effects, characterizing the transition as of a correlation-assisted Peierls type. In this paper we present a detailed analysis of the excitation spectrum of the insulating M1 phase of VO(2), based on this calculation. We implement a scheme to analytically continue self-energies from Matsubara to real frequencies, and study the physics of the strong interactions, as well as the corresponding changes with respect to the density functional theory band structure within the local density approximation (LDA). We find that in the M1 phase lifetime effects are rather negligible, indeed allowing for an effective band structure description. A frequency-independent but orbital-dependent potential, constructed as an approximation to the full cluster dynamical mean field self-energy, turns out to satisfactorily reproduce the fully interacting one-particle spectrum, acting as a scissors operator which pushes the a(1g) bonding and e(g)($\pi$) bands apart and, thus, opens the gap.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

It is shown that the volume of this surface in momentum space is unaffected by the interaction. The same analytic properties are shown to lead, by direct statistical mechanical arguments, to simple expressions for the low- temperature heat capacity, the spin paramagnetism, and the compressibility of the system. These expressions are very analogous to the corresponding expressions for noninteracting particles. Finally, it is shown how the whole formalism may be generalized when an external periodic potential is present (band case).},

abstract = {We analyze a mean-field model of electrons with pure forward scattering interactions on a square lattice which exhibits spontaneous Fermi surface symmetry breaking with a d-wave order parameter: the surface expands along the kx-axis and shrinks along the ky-axis (or vice versa). The symmetry-broken phase is stabilized below a dome-shaped transition line Tc(mu), with a maximal Tc near van Hove filling. The phase transition is usually first order at the edges of the transition line, and always second order around its center. The d-wave compressibility of the Fermi surface is however strongly enhanced even near the first order transition down to zero temperature. In the weak coupling limit the phase diagram is fully determined by a single non-universal energy scale, and hence dimensionless ratios of different characteristic quantities are universal. Adding a uniform repulsion to the forward scattering interaction, the two tricritical points at the ends of the second order transition line are shifted to lower temperatures. For a particularly favorable choice of hopping and interaction parameters one of the first order edges is replaced completely by a second order transition line, leading to a quantum critical point.},

abstract = {We report the first observation of conduction electron spin resonance (CESR) in both the normal and superconducting states of pure niobium. Surprisingly, the resonance displays a g value of 1.84±0.01 in both states. The linewidth narrows considerably in the superconducting state. We show that this narrowing is a consequence of the coherence factors which, in BCS theory, modify all scattering matrix elements. The relaxation linewidth for spin-orbit scattering off impurities is calculated as a function of temperature. It decreases, monotonically below Tc, in a qualitative agreement with the observed linewidth.},

(ii) The use of general yet powerful criteria for the truncation of infinite sums; in particular, the Coulomb electron-electron interactions are subdivided into terms corresponding to intersecting or nonintersecting charge distributions; the latter are grouped into shell contributions and the interaction is evaluated by multipolar expansions; the exchange interaction may be evaluated with great precision by retaining a relatively small number of two-electron integrals according to a truncation criterion which fully preserves its nonlocal character. (iii) The use of a procedure for performing integrals over k, as needed in the evaluation of the Fermi energy and in the reconstruction of the Fock matrix, which is particularly simple because it employs partially intersecting small spheres as integration subdomains where linear extrapolation is admitted. A comparison is finally made of our fundamental equations in the critical SCF stage with those obtainable by a recent proposal which uses Fourier transforms to express Coulomb and exchange integrals.},

The interest for developing efficient methods is motivated by recent discoveries and characterizations of strongly correlated electron materials and by requirements for understanding mechanisms of intriguing phenomena beyond a single-particle picture. A three-stage scheme is developed as renormalized multi-scale solvers (RMS) utilizing the hierarchical electronic structure in the energy space. It provides us with an ab initio downfolding of the global band structure into low-energy effective models followed by low-energy solvers for the models. The RMS method is illustrated with examples of several materials. In particular, we overview cases such as dynamics of semiconductors, transition metals and its compounds including iron-based superconductors and perovskite oxides, as well as organic conductors of kappa-ET type.},

We explain why this form of self-consistency should be preferred to the conventional one. Some results for Si (a representative semiconductor) are presented. Finally we consider many details in the electronic structure of the antiferromagnetic insulators MnO and NiO. Excellent agreement with experiment is shown for many properties, suggesting that a Landau quasiparticle (energy band) picture provides a reasonable description of electronic structure even in these correlated materials.},

@article{Arkani-Hamed2012,
abstract = {We establish a direct connection between scattering amplitudes in planar four-dimensional theories and a remarkable mathematical structure known as the positive Grassmannian. The central physical idea is to focus on on-shell diagrams as objects of fundamental importance to scattering amplitudes. We show that the all-loop integrand in N=4 SYM is naturally represented in this way. On-shell diagrams in this theory are intimately tied to a variety of mathematical objects, ranging from a new graphical representation of permutations to a beautiful stratification of the Grassmannian G(k,n) which generalizes the notion of a simplex in projective space. All physically important operations involving on-shell diagrams map to canonical operations on permutations; in particular, BCFW deformations correspond to adjacent transpositions. Each cell of the positive Grassmannian is naturally endowed with positive coordinates and an invariant measure which determines the on-shell function associated with the diagram. This understanding allows us to classify and compute all on-shell diagrams, and give a geometric understanding for all the non-trivial relations among them. Yangian invariance of scattering amplitudes is transparently represented by diffeomorphisms of G(k,n) which preserve the positive structure. Scattering amplitudes in (1+1)-dimensional integrable systems and the ABJM theory in (2+1) dimensions can both be understood as special cases of these ideas. On-shell diagrams in theories with less (or no) supersymmetry are associated with exactly the same structures in the Grassmannian, but with a measure deformed by a factor encoding ultraviolet singularities. The Grassmannian representation of on-shell processes also gives a new understanding of the all-loop integrand for scattering amplitudes, presenting all integrands in a novel dLog form which directly reflects the underlying positive structure.},

@article{Kaminski2002,
abstract = {A change in 'symmetry' is often observed when matter undergoes a phase transition-the symmetry is said to be spontaneously broken. The transition made by underdoped high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductors is unusual, in that it is not a mean-field transition as seen in other superconductors. Rather, there is a region in the phase diagram above the superconducting transition temperature Tc (where phase coherence and superconductivity begin) but below a characteristic temperature T* where a 'pseudogap' appears in the spectrum of electronic excitations. It is therefore important to establish if T* is just a cross-over temperature arising from fluctuations in the order parameter that will establish superconductivity at Tc (refs 3, 4), or if it marks a phase transition where symmetry is spontaneously broken. Here we report that, for a material in the pseudogap state, left-circularly polarized photons give a different photocurrent from right-circularly polarized photons. This shows that time-reversal symmetry is spontaneously broken below T*, which therefore corresponds to a phase transition.},

In contrast to this, Fe-doping near the surface produces both isovalent and heterovalent substitution (Fe3+ → Zn2+). The calculations performed herein suggest that the most likely defect structure is the single or double substitution of Zn with Fe, although, if additional oxygen is available, then Fe substitution with interstitial oxygen is even more energetically favorable. Furthermore, it is found that ferromagnetic states are energetically unfavorable, and ferromagnetic ordering is likely to be realized only through the formation of a secondary phase (i.e., ZnFe2O 4), or codoping with Cu. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Chemical Society.},

We report an implementation of the method in a form suitable for accepting the input electronic structure from USPP plane-wave DFT simulations. We apply the method to the calculation of Wannier functions, dipole moments and spontaneous polarizations for a range of test cases.

abstract = {The thermal transport of a dielectric solid can be determined by means of the Boltzmann equation regarding its distribution of phonons subjected to a thermal gradient. After solving the equation, the thermal conductivity is obtained. A largely used approach for the solution is that of considering a relaxation time approximation, where the collisions of phonons are represented by relaxation times. This approximation can be questionable, but its use is able of providing reliable information on thermal conductivity and on the role of impurities and lattice defects in the thermal transport. Here we start a discussion on the thermal conductivity in dielectric solids. The discussion is divided in two parts. In the first part, which is proposed in this paper, we analyse the Boltzmann equation and its solution in the relaxation time approximation. In a second part, which will be the subject of a next paper, we will show comparison of calculated and measured thermal conductivities.},

abstract = {A two-step, high-purity, high-yield synthesis of nanoparticulate vanadium dioxide, which has a greater than 10-fold potential cost reduction is reported. This consists of a short reflux of V2O5 with aspartic acid, followed by calcination at 600 degrees C or above. The particles produced have a mean diameter of approximately 90 nm with phase change characteristics of transition temperature and enthalpy that compare favorably with a commercial standard. In cases where the reduction reaction has progressed too far and a mixture of vanadium(III) and -(IV) is formed, redispersion and aging of the particulate product in water preferentially oxidizes the vanadium(III) component to vanadium(IV), thus allowing a versatile route to achieving a high-purity material. The synthesis was also used to deposit high-purity phases of VO2 onto the surfaces of other particles, and significant differences in the structural phase transition behavior and even the crystal structure were found for deposited samples. The data suggest that substrate properties may affect the characteristics of the structural phase transition, and this has significant implications for measurements on, and applications of, deposited VO2 layers and films.},

abstract = {Optical excitation of apical oxygen vibrations in YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6+\delta}$ has been shown to enhance its c-axis superconducting-phase rigidity, as evidenced by a transient blue shift of the equilibrium inter-bilayer Josephson plasma resonance. Surprisingly, a transient c-axis plasma mode could also be induced above T$_{c}$ by the same apical oxygen excitation, suggesting light activated superfluid tunneling throughout the pseudogap phase of YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6+\delta}$. However, despite the similarities between the above T$_{c}$ transient plasma mode and the equilibrium Josephson plasmon, alternative explanations involving high mobility quasiparticle transport should be considered. Here, we report an extensive study of the relaxation of the light-induced plasmon into the equilibrium incoherent phase. These new experiments allow for a critical assessment of the nature of this mode. We determine that the transient plasma relaxes through a collapse of its coherence length rather than its carrier (or superfluid) density. These observations are not easily reconciled with quasiparticle interlayer transport, and rather support transient superfluid tunneling as the origin of the light-induced interlayer coupling in YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6+\delta}$.},

abstract = {Unconventional superconductivity (SC) is said to occur when Cooper pair formation is dominated by repulsive electron-electron interactions, so that the symmetry of the pair wave function is other than an isotropic s-wave. The strong, on-site, repulsive electron-electron interactions that are the proximate cause of such SC are more typically drivers of commensurate magnetism. Indeed, it is the suppression of commensurate antiferromagnetism (AF) that usually allows this type of unconventional superconductivity to emerge. Importantly, however, intervening between these AF and SC phases, intertwined electronic ordered phases (IP) of an unexpected nature are frequently discovered. For this reason, it has been extremely difficult to distinguish the microscopic essence of the correlated superconductivity from the often spectacular phenomenology of the IPs. Here we introduce a model conceptual framework within which to understand the relationship between AF electron-electron interactions, IPs, and correlated SC. We demonstrate its effectiveness in simultaneously explaining the consequences of AF interactions for the copper-based, iron-based, and heavy-fermion superconductors, as well as for their quite distinct IPs.},

abstract = {We aim to give a pedagogical introduction to those elementary aspects of superconductivity which are not treated in the classic textbooks. In particular, we emphasize that global U(1) phase rotation symmetry, and not gauge symmetry, is spontaneously violated, and show that the BCS wave function is, contrary to claims in the literature, fully gauge invariant. We discuss the nature of the order parameter, the physical origin of the many degenerate states, and the relation between formulations of superconductivity with fixed particle numbers vs. well-defined phases. We motivate and to some extend derive the effective field theory at low temperatures, explore symmetries and conservation laws, and justify the classical nature of the theory. Most importantly, we show that the entire phenomenology of superconductivity essentially follows from the single assumption of a charged order parameter field. This phenomenology includes Anderson's characteristic equations of superfluidity, electric and magnetic screening, the Bernoulli Hall effect, the balance of the Lorentz force, as well as the quantum effects, in which Planck's constant manifests itself through the compactness of the U (1) phase field. The latter effects include flux quantization, phase slippage, and the Josephson effect. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Neutron and X-ray scattering experiments have provided mounting evidence for spin and charge ordering phenomena in underdoped cuprates. These range from early work on stripe correlations in Nd-LSCO to the latest discovery of charge-density-waves in YBa2Cu3O(6+x). Both phenomena are characterized by a pronounced dependence on doping, temperature and an externally applied magnetic field. Here, we show that these electron-lattice instabilities exhibit also a previously unrecognized bulk-surface dichotomy. Surface-sensitive electronic and structural probes uncover a temperature-dependent evolution of the CuO2 plane band dispersion and apparent Fermi pockets in underdoped Bi2 Sr(2-x) La(x) CuO(6+$\delta$) (Bi2201), which is directly associated with an hitherto-undetected strong temperature dependence of the incommensurate superstructure periodicity below 130 K. In stark contrast, the structural modulation revealed by bulk-sensitive probes is temperature-independent. These findings point to a surface-enhanced incipient charge-density-wave instability, driven by Fermi surface nesting. This discovery is of critical importance in the interpretation of single-particle spectroscopy data, and establishes the surface of cuprates and other complex oxides as a rich playground for the study of electronically soft phases.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {{\AA}} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Here we show that, in the case of small gap transition metal oxides, such as VO2, with rather subtle physics in the vicinity of the Fermi surface, such hybrid functional schemes without the inclusion of “expensive” fully self-consistent GW corrections fail to yield this physics and incorrectly describe the features of the wave function of states near the Fermi surface. While a fully self-consistent GW on top of a hybrid functional approach does correct these wave functions as expected, and is found to be in general agreement with the results of a fully self-consistent GW approach based on semilocal functionals, it is much more computationally demanding as compared to the latter approach for the benefit of essentially the same results.},

@article{Rabe2013,
abstract = {The fundamental physics of antiferroelectric oxides and their properties are reviewed. First, the difficulties in formulating a precise definition of antiferroelectricity are discussed, drawing on previous discussion in the literature. We arrive at the following definition: an antiferroelectric is the same as a ferroelectric in that its structure is obtained through distortion of a nonpolar high-symmetry reference phase; for ferroelectrics, the distortion is polar, while for antiferroelectrics it is nonpolar. However, not all nonpolar phases thus obtained are antiferroelectric: in addition, there must be an alternative low-energy ferroelectric phase obtained by a polar distortion of the same high-symmetry reference structure, and an applied electric field must induce a first-order transition from the antiferroelectric phase to this ferroelectric phase, producing a characteristic P–E double hysteresis loop. For analysis of the characteristic properties of antiferroelectrics, we use Landau theory functionals. The microscopic origins of the macroscopic behavior are examined. This is fairly straightforward for systems with clearly defined reorientable local-dipolar entities, such as antiferroelectric liquid crystals and hydrogen-bonded antiferroelecrics, and these systems are not discussed in detail in this chapter. The main focus is on the subtler case of antiferroelectric oxides, for which models based on symmetry-adapted lattice modes prove to be useful. Specific examples of antiferroelectric oxides are presented with available first-principles results and discussion of the role of compositional tuning in producing antiferroelectricity, and the nature of the electric-field-induced ferroelectric phases. In thin films and superlattices, additional tuning is possible through the effects of strain and finite size. This chapter concludes with some remarks on materials design, including the optimization of properties relevant to technological applications of antiferroelectrics.},

Both metallic rutile and insulating low-temperature NbO2, which crystallizes in a distorted rutile structure, are correctly described within density functional theory and the local density approximation.

Hybridization of both types of bands is almost negligible outside narrow rods along the line X-R.

abstract = {A change in 'symmetry' is often observed when matter undergoes a phase transition-the symmetry is said to be spontaneously broken. The transition made by underdoped high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductors is unusual, in that it is not a mean-field transition as seen in other superconductors. Rather, there is a region in the phase diagram above the superconducting transition temperature Tc (where phase coherence and superconductivity begin) but below a characteristic temperature T* where a 'pseudogap' appears in the spectrum of electronic excitations. It is therefore important to establish if T* is just a cross-over temperature arising from fluctuations in the order parameter that will establish superconductivity at Tc (refs 3, 4), or if it marks a phase transition where symmetry is spontaneously broken. Here we report that, for a material in the pseudogap state, left-circularly polarized photons give a different photocurrent from right-circularly polarized photons. This shows that time-reversal symmetry is spontaneously broken below T*, which therefore corresponds to a phase transition.},

abstract = {High temperature superconductivity emerges from the antiferromagnetic Mott state when holes are introduced into the CuO2 plane. The electronic structure created by that process1 is not understood, although changes in the electronic state of oxygen atoms appear paramount2-5. Hole doping first destroys the Mott state yielding a weak insulator6,7 where electrons localize only at low temperatures without a full energy gap. At higher doping, the pseudogap state, a weakly conducting state with a large anisotropic energy gap and intra-unit-cell breaking of 90{\textordmasculine}-rotational (C4v) symmetry appears3,4,8-10. However, a direct visualization of the emergence of these phenomena with increasing hole density has never been achieved. Here we report atomic-scale imaging of electronic structure evolution from the weak-insulator through the emergence of the pseudogap to the superconducting state in Ca2-xNaxCuO2Cl2. We find that the spectral signature characteristic of the pseudogap emerges at lowest doping from a weakly insulating but C4v-symmetric matrix that has its own characteristic spectral shape. Then at slightly higher hole-density, nanoscale regions exhibiting pseudogap spectra and 180{\textordmasculine}-rotational (C2v) symmetry form unidirectional clusters within the 2 C4v-symmetric matrix. These findings indicate that doping proceeds by the appearance of nanoscale clusters of localized holes within which the broken-symmetry pseudogap state is stabilized. A fundamentally two-component electronic structure11 then exists until the C2v-symmetric clusters touch each other at higher doping. It is at this stage that the long-range high-Tc superconductivity appears in Ca2-xNaxCuO2Cl2},

The development of frequency-agile metamaterials has helped to alleviate these bandwidth restrictions by allowing real-time tuning of the metamaterial frequency response. We demonstrate electrically controlled persistent frequency tuning of a metamaterial, which allows the lasting modification of its response by using a transient stimulus. This work demonstrates a form of memory capacitance that interfaces metamaterials with a class of devices known collectively as memory devices.},

Allowing the lattice to fluctuate introduces curvature, with the construction of the curvature form following the usual approach however the three phonons in three dimensions require three gauge fields, and therefore an SU(2) structure. Symmetry-breaking is incorporated by applying the SU(2) interaction vertices simultaneously on neighbouring unit cells, which allows both spin-ordering and Peierls pairing, and this generates linear combinations of neighbouring electron position state wavefunctions, lowering the crystal symmetry and opening a band gap. The occurrence of strong electron-phonon coupling accompanied by phonon softening is incorporated easily as it simply adds a constant to the tight-binding phase at each lattice site, thus modifying the ground state lattice structure.},

@article{Shin1990,
abstract = {Vacuum-ultraviolet reflectance and photoemission spectra of VO2, V2O3, V6O13, and V2O5 are measured in order to investigate the 3d-band structures and electron-correlation effects. In the case of VO2, drastic changes in the 3d (pi* and d||) band structures are found in both spectra through the metal-insulator phase transition. The pi* and d|| bands are found at the Fermi level and Eb=1.3 eV in the photoemission spectra of metallic VO2. In the insulating phase, the pi* valence band in the photoemission spectra becomes empty and a rise of the pi* conduction band by about 0.5 eV is found in the reflectance spectra. This band shift through the phase transition may be a driving force of the metal-insulator transition of VO2. The optical band gap between the d|| valence and pi* conduction bands is obtained as 0.7 eV in the insulating phase, to which the pi*-d|| correlation energy contributes partially. The splitting of the d|| band is also found in the insulating phase. This splitting energy is about 2.5 eV, while the bandwidth of the d|| band is about 1.5 eV. This large band splitting is mainly due to the correlation energy of d|| electrons of about U(d||, d||)=2.1 eV. On the other hand, no drastic change is found in the 3d-band structures of V6O13 and V2O3 except for slight changes in the bandwidths. Furthermore, the density of states at the Fermi level is rather low in these materials even in the metallic phase. These facts support the view that the electron-correlation effects are important and Mott-type metal-insulator transitions are induced in V6O13 and V2O3. Resonant photoemission from V3d and O2p bands are observed as the photon energy is swept through the 3p->3d optical-absorption transition. The resonance profiles of V3d bands show the characteristic antiresonance dip, while those of O2p bands show rather broad and simple enhancements. The multiplet structures in the 3p core photoemission spectra of VO2 and V203 are quantitatively analyzed with use of results from the calculations of Yamaguchi et al.},

Giustino et al. calculated that in the high temperature superconductor La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 crystal lattice vibrations (phonons) should have a negligible effect on photoemission spectra and concluded that phonons do not play an important role. We show that the calculations employed by Giustino et al. fail to reproduce huge influence of electron-phonon coupling on important phonons observed in experiments. Thus one would expect these calculations to similarly fail in explaining the role of electron-phonon coupling for the electronic dispersion.},

abstract = {A phonon often is described as ‘‘a quantum of lattice vibration,'' but this description can be difficult to reconcile with the wave functions explored in a typical undergraduate quantum mechanics class. A phonon wave function is similar to the harmonic oscillator wave functions studied in introductory quantum mechanics, except that it is many-dimensional. We suggest a way to visualize the probability density for this very high-dimensional wave function. The resulting pictures are especially clear and intuitive for a coherent state, which is both a good approximation to a sound wave and a discrete analog to laser light. These pictures can also provide a qualitative introduction to quantum field theory.},

abstract = {There is a strong intuitive understanding of renormalization, due to Wilson, in terms of the scaling of effective lagrangians. We show that this can be made the basis for a proof of perturbative renormalization. We first study renormalizability in the language of renormalization group flows for a toy renormalization group equation. We then derive an exact renormalization group equation for a four-dimensional $\lambda${{\o}}4 theory with a momentum cutoff. We organize the cutoff dependence of the effective lagrangian into relevant and irrelevant parts, and derive a linear equation for the irrelevant part. A lengthy but straightforward argument establishes that the piece identified as irrelevant actually is so in perturbation theory. This implies renormalizability. The method extends immediately to any system in which a momentum-space cutoff can be used, but the principle is more general and should apply for any physical cutoff. Neither Weinberg's theorem nor arguments based on the topology of graphs are needed.},

We derive exactly soluble Hamiltonians for 2D local bosonic models whose ground states are string-net condensed states. Those ground states correspond to 2D parity invariant topological phases. These models reveal the mathematical framework underlying topological phases: tensor category theory. One of the Hamiltonians - a spin-1/2 system on the honeycomb lattice - is a simple theoretical realization of a fault tolerant quantum computer. The higher dimensional case also yields an interesting result: we find that 3D string-net condensation naturally gives rise to both emergent gauge bosons and emergent fermions. Thus, string-net condensation provides a mechanism for unifying gauge bosons and fermions in 3 and higher dimensions.},

This analysis is performed based on pure Yang-Mills theories in the Landau gauge, within the theoretical framework that emerges from the combination of the pinch technique with the background field method. In particular, we concentrate on the Schwinger-Dyson equation satisfied by the gluon propagator and examine the necessary conditions for obtaining finite solutions within the infrared region. The role of seagull diagrams receives particular attention, as do the identities that enforce the cancellation of all potential quadratic divergences. We stress the necessity of introducing nonperturbative massless poles in the fully dressed vertices of the theory in order to trigger the Schwinger mechanism, and explain in detail the instrumental role of these poles in maintaining the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin symmetry at every step of the mass-generating procedure. The dynamical equation governing the evolution of the gluon mass is derived, and its solutions are determined numerically following implementation of a set of simplifying assumptions. The obtained mass function is positive definite, and exhibits a power law running that is consistent with general arguments based on the operator product expansion in the ultraviolet region. A possible connection between confinement and the presence of an inflection point in the gluon propagator is briefly discussed.},

We show that Mott physics plays an essential role in all phases of VO$_2$: undimerized vanadium atoms undergo classical Mott transition through local moment formation (in the M$_2$ phase), while strong superexchange within V-dimers adds significant dynamic intersite correlations, which remove the singularity of self-energy for dimerized V-atoms. The resulting transition from rutile to dimerized M$_1$ phase is adiabatically connected to Peierls-like transition, but is better characterized as the Mott transition in the presence of strong intersite exchange. As a consequence of Mott physics, the gap in the dimerized M$_1$ phase is temperature dependent. The sole increase of electronic temperature collapses the gap, reminiscent of recent experiments.},

@article{Schwinger1949,
abstract = {The discussion of vacuum polarization in the previous paper of this series was confined to that produced by the field of a prescribed current distribution. We now consider the induction of current in the vacuum by an electron, which is a dynamical system and an entity indistinguishable from the particles associated with vacuum fluctuations. The additional current thus attributed to an electron implies an alteration in its electromagnetic properties which will be revealed by scattering in a Coulomb field and by energy level displacements. This paper is concerned with the computation of the second-order corrections to the current operator and the application to electron scattering. Radiative corrections to energy levels will be treated in the next paper of the series. Following a canonical transformation which effectively renormalizes the electron mass, the correction to the current operator produced by the coupling with the electromagnetic field is developed in a power series, of which first- and second-order terms are retained. One thus obtains second-order modifications in the current operator which are of the same general nature as the previously treated vacuum polarization current, save for a contribution that has the form of a dipole current. The latter implies a fractional increase of $\alpha$/2$\pi$ in the spin magnetic moment of the electron. The only flaw in the second-order current correction is a logarithmic divergence attributable to an infra-red catastrophe. It is remarked that, in the presence of an external field, the first-order current correction will introduce a compensating divergence. Thus, the second-order corrections to particle electromagnetic properties cannot be completely stated without regard for the manner of exhibiting them by an external field. Accordingly, we consider in the second section the interaction of three systems, the matter field, the electromagnetic field, and a given current distribution. It is shown that this situation can be described in terms of an external potential coupled to the current operator, as modified by the interaction with the vacuum electromagnetic field. Application is made to the scattering of an electron by an external field, in which the latter is regarded as a small perturbation. It is found convenient to calculate the total rate at which collisions occur and then identify the cross sections for individual events. The correction to the cross section for radiationless scattering is determined by the second-order correction to the current operator, while scattering that is accompanied by single quantum emission is a consequence of the first-order current correction. The final object of calculation is the differential cross section for scattering through a given angle with a prescribed maximum energy loss, which is completely free of divergences. Detailed evaluations are given in two situations, the essentially elastic scattering of an electron, in which only a small fraction of the kinetic energy is radiated, and the scattering of a slowly moving electron with unrestricted energy loss. The Appendix is devoted to an alternative treatment of the polarization of the vacuum by an external field. The conditions imposed on the induced current by the charge conservation and gauge invariance requirements are examined. It is found that the fulfillment of these formal properties requires the vanishing of an integral that is not absolutely convergent, but naturally vanishes for reasons of symmetry. This null integral is then used to simplify the expression for the induced current in such a manner that direct calculation yields a gauge invariant result. The induced current contains a logarithmically divergent multiple of the external current, which implies that a non-vanishing total charge, proportional to the external charge, is induced in the vacuum. The apparent contradiction with charge conservation is resolved by showing that a compensating charge escapes to infinity. Finally, the expression for the electromagnetic mass of the electron is treated with the methods developed in this paper.},

abstract = {The electronic ground state of a periodic system is usually described in terms of extended Bloch orbitals, but an alternative representation in terms of localized "Wannier functions" was introduced by Gregory Wannier in 1937. The connection between the Bloch and Wannier representations is realized by families of transformations in a continuous space of unitary matrices, carrying a large degree of arbitrariness. Since 1997, methods have been developed that allow one to iteratively transform the extended Bloch orbitals of a first-principles calculation into a unique set of maximally localized Wannier functions, accomplishing the solid-state equivalent of constructing localized molecular orbitals, or "Boys orbitals" as previously known from the chemistry literature. These developments are reviewed here, and a survey of the applications of these methods is presented. This latter includes a description of their use in analyzing the nature of chemical bonding, or as a local probe of phenomena related to electric polarization and orbital magnetization. Wannier interpolation schemes are also reviewed, by which quantities computed on a coarse reciprocal-space mesh can be used to interpolate onto much finer meshes at low cost, and applications in which Wannier functions are used as efficient basis functions are discussed. Finally the construction and use of Wannier functions outside the context of electronic-structure theory is presented, for cases that include phonon excitations, photonic crystals, and cold-atom optical lattices. {{\textcopyright}} 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Using the large- N limit of the t – J model and also allowing for phonons and the electron–phonon interaction, we study the isotope effect $\alpha$ for coupling constants appropriate for YB 2 C 3 O y . We find that $\alpha$ has a minimum at optimal doping and increases strongly (slightly) towards the underdoped (overdoped) region. Using values for the electron–phonon interaction from the local density approximation we get good agreement for $\alpha$ as a function of T c and doping $\delta$ with recent experimental data in YB 2 C 3 O y . Our results strongly suggest that the large increase of $\alpha$ in the underdoped region is (a) caused by the shift of electronic spectral density from low to high energies associated with a competing phase (in our case a charge density wave) and the formation of a gap, and (b) compatible with the small electron–phonon coupling constants obtained from the local density approximation. We propose a similar explanation for the anomalous behavior of $\alpha$ in Sr-doped La 2 CuO 4 near the doping 1/8.},

abstract = {During the past decade, ab initio methods to calculate the electronic structure of materials based on hybrid functionals have increasingly become widely popular. Here we show that, in the case of small gap transition metal oxides, such as VO2, with rather subtle physics in the vicinity of the Fermi surface, such hybrid functional schemes without the inclusion of “expensive” fully self-consistent GW corrections fail to yield this physics and incorrectly describe the features of the wave function of states near the Fermi surface. While a fully self-consistent GW on top of a hybrid functional approach does correct these wave functions as expected, and is found to be in general agreement with the results of a fully self-consistent GW approach based on semilocal functionals, it is much more computationally demanding as compared to the latter approach for the benefit of essentially the same results.},

abstract = {The stability of nonrelativistic fermionic systems to interactions is studied within the Renormalization Group framework. A brief introduction to {$}\backslashphi{\^{}}4{$} theory in four dimensions and the path integral formulation for fermions is given. The strategy is as follows. First, the modes on either side of the Fermi surface within a cut-off {$}\backslashLambda{\$} are chosen and a path integral is written to describe them. An RG transformation which eliminates a part of these modes, but preserves the action of the noninteracting system is identified. Finally the possible perturbations of this free-field fixed point are classified as relevant, irrelevant or marginal. A {$}d=1{$} warmup calculation involving a system of fermions shows how, in contrast to mean-field theory, the RG correctly yields a scale invariant system (Luttinger liquid) In {$}d=2{$} and 3, for rotationally invariant Fermi surfaces, {{}$\$em automatically{}} leads to Landau's Fermi liquid theory, which appears as a fixed point characterized by an effective mass and a Landau function {$}F{$}, with the only relevant perturbations being of the superconducting (BCS) type The functional flow equations for the BCS couplings are derived and separated into an infinite number of flows, one for each angular momentum. It is shown that similar results hold for rotationally non-invariant (but time-reversal invariant) Fermi surfaces also, A study of a nested Fermi surface shows an additional relevant flow leading to charge density wave formation. For small {$}\backslashLambda / K{_}F{$}, a 1/N expansion emerges, with {$}N = K{_}F/ \backslashLambda{\$}, which explains why one is able to solve the narrow cut-off theory.

@article{DelaCruz2008,
abstract = {Following the discovery of long-range antiferromagnetic order in the parent compounds of high-transition-temperature (high-T(c)) copper oxides, there have been efforts to understand the role of magnetism in the superconductivity that occurs when mobile 'electrons' or 'holes' are doped into the antiferromagnetic parent compounds. Superconductivity in the newly discovered rare-earth iron-based oxide systems ROFeAs (R, rare-earth metal) also arises from either electron or hole doping of their non-superconducting parent compounds. The parent material LaOFeAs is metallic but shows anomalies near 150 K in both resistivity and d.c. magnetic susceptibility. Although optical conductivity and theoretical calculations suggest that LaOFeAs exhibits a spin-density-wave (SDW) instability that is suppressed by doping with electrons to induce superconductivity, there has been no direct evidence of SDW order. Here we report neutron-scattering experiments that demonstrate that LaOFeAs undergoes an abrupt structural distortion below 155 K, changing the symmetry from tetragonal (space group P4/nmm) to monoclinic (space group P112/n) at low temperatures, and then, at approximately 137 K, develops long-range SDW-type antiferromagnetic order with a small moment but simple magnetic structure. Doping the system with fluorine suppresses both the magnetic order and the structural distortion in favour of superconductivity. Therefore, like high-T(c) copper oxides, the superconducting regime in these iron-based materials occurs in close proximity to a long-range-ordered antiferromagnetic ground state.},

abstract = {We compute the electronic band structure and optical properties of boron arsenide using the relativistic quasiparticle self-consistent GW approach, including electron-hole interactions through solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation. We also calculate its electronic and optical properties using standard and hybrid density functional theory. We demonstrate that the inclusion of self-consistency and vertex corrections provides substantial improvement in the calculated band features, in particular, when comparing our results to previous calculations using the single-shot GW approach and various density functional theory (DFT) methods, from which a considerable scatter in the calculated indirect and direct band gaps has been observed. We find that BAs has an indirect gap of 1.674 eV and a direct gap of 3.990 eV, consistent with experiment and other comparable computational studies. Hybrid DFT reproduces the indirect gap well, but provides less accurate values for other band features, including spin-orbit splittings. Our computed Born effective charges and dielectric constants confirm the unusually covalent bonding characteristics of this III-V system.},

In large molecules and solids, however, calculating the exact (Hartree-Fock) exchange is computationally expensive, especially for systems with metallic characteristics. In the present work, we develop a new hybrid density functional based on a screened Coulomb potential for the exchange interaction which circumvents this bottleneck. The results obtained for structural and thermodynamic properties of molecules are comparable in quality to the most widely used hybrid functionals. In addition, we present results of periodic boundary condition calculations for both semiconducting and metallic single wall carbon nanotubes. Using a screened Coulomb potential for Hartree-Fock exchange enables fast and accurate hybrid calculations, even of usually difficult metallic systems. The high accuracy of the new screened Coulomb potential hybrid, combined with its computational advantages, makes it widely applicable to large molecules and periodic systems.

abstract = {The critical theory of the onset of antiferromagnetism in metals, with concomitant Fermi surface reconstruction, has recently been shown to be strongly coupled in two spatial dimensions. The onset of unconventional superconductivity near this critical point is reviewed: it involves a subtle interplay between the breakdown of fermionic quasiparticle excitations on the Fermi surface and the strong pairing glue provided by the antiferromagnetic fluctuations. The net result is a logarithm-squared enhancement of the pairing vertex for generic Fermi surfaces, with a universal dimensionless coefficient independent of the strength of interactions, which is expected to lead to superconductivity at the scale of the Fermi energy. We also discuss the possibility that the antiferromagnetic critical point can be replaced by an intermediate 'fractionalized Fermi liquid' phase, in which there is Fermi surface reconstruction but no long-range antiferromagnetic order. We discuss the relevance of this phase to the underdoped cuprates and the heavy fermion materials.},

abstract = {The relativistic S-matrix formalism of Feynman is applied to the bound-state problem for two interacting Fermi-Dirac particles. The bound state is described by a wave function depending on separate times for each of the two particles. Two alternative integral equations for this wave function are derived with kernels in the form of an expansion in powers of g2, the dimensionless coupling constant for the interaction. Each term in these expansions gives Lorentz-invariant equations. The validity and physical significance of these equations is discussed. In extreme nonrelativistic approximation and to lowest order in g2 they reduce to the appropriate Schr{{\"{o}}}dinger equation. One of these integral equations is applied to the deuteron ground state using scalar mesons of mass $\mu$ with scalar coupling. For neutral mesons the Lorentz-invariant interaction is transformed into the sum of the instantaneous Yukawa interaction and a retarded correction term. The value obtained for g2 differs only by a fraction proportional to ($\mu$/M)2 from that obtained by using a phenomenological Yukawa potential. For a purely charged meson theory a correction term is obtained by a direct solution of the relativistic integral equation using only the first term in the expansion of the kernel. This correction is due to the fact that a nucleon can emit, or absorb, positive and negative mesons only alternately. The constant g2 is increased by a fraction of 1.1($\mu$/M) or 15 percent.},

abstract = {This article reviews the theory of electron-phonon interactions in solids from the point of view of ab-initio calculations. While the electron-phonon interaction has been studied for almost a century, predictive non-empirical calculations have become feasible only during the past two decades. Today it is possible to calculate from first principles many materials properties related to the electron-phonon interaction, including the critical temperature of conventional superconductors, the carrier mobility in semiconductors, the temperature dependence of optical spectra in direct and indirect-gap semiconductors, the relaxation rates of photoexcited carriers, the electron mass renormalization in angle-resolved photoelectron spectra, and the non-adiabatic corrections to phonon dispersion relations. Here we review the theoretical and computational framework underlying modern electron-phonon calculations from first principles, as well as landmark investigations of the electron-phonon interaction in real materials. In the first part of the article we summarize the elementary theory of electron-phonon interactions and their calculations based on density-functional theory. In the second part we discuss a general field-theoretic formulation of the electron-phonon problem, and establish the connection with practical first-principles calculations. In the third part we review a number of recent investigations of electron-phonon interactions in the areas of vibrational spectroscopy, photoelectron spectoscopy, optical spectroscopy, transport, and superconductivity.},

We postulate that the number of spin-2 fields interacting at a single vertex is limited by the number of spacetime dimensions. We then show that, for the case of two spin-2 fields, the vielbein theory is equivalent to the recently proposed theories of ghost-free massive gravity and bi-metric gravity. The vielbein formulation greatly simplifies the proof that these theories have an extra primary constraint which eliminates the Boulware-Deser ghost.\n\nPublished in: JHEP 07(2012)047},

abstract = {Bismuth tri-iodide (BiI 3 ) is an intermediate band gap semiconductor with potential for room temperature gamma-ray detection applications. Remarkably, very different band gap characteristics and values of BiI 3 have been reported in literature, which may be attributed to its complicated layered structure with strongly bound BiI 6 octahedra held together by weak van der Waals interactions. Here, to resolve this discrepancy, the band gap of BiI 3 was characterized through optical and computational methods and differences among previously reported values are discussed. Unpolarized transmittance and reflectance spectra in the visible to near ultraviolet (UV-Vis) range at room temperature yielded an indirect band gap of 1.67 ± 0.09 eV, while spectroscopic ellipsometry detected a direct band gap at 1.96 ± 0.05 eV and higher energy critical point features. The discrepancy between the UV-Vis and ellipsometry results originates from the low optical absorption coefficients ($\alpha$ ∼ 10 2 cm -1 ) of BiI 3 that renders reflection-based ellipsometry insensitive to the indirect gap for this material. Further, electronic-structure calculations of the band structure by density functional theory methods are also consistent with the presence of an indirect band gap of 1.55 eV in BiI 3 . Based on this, an indirect band gap with a value of 1.67 ± 0.09 eV is considered to best represent the band gap structure and value for single crystal BiI 3 . {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

Concomitantly, the coherent k-space topology undergoes an abrupt transition, from arcs to closed contours, at the same p(c).

@article{Pines1952,
abstract = {The behavior of the electrons in a dense electron gas is analyzed in terms of their density Quctuations. These density Quctuations may be split into two components. One component is associated with the organized oscillation of the system as a whole, the so-called "plasma"' oscillation. The other is associated with the random thermal motion of the individual electrons and shows no collective behavior. It represents a collection of individual elec-trons surrounded by comoving clouds of charge which screen the electron Gelds within a distance of the order of magnitude of the Debye length. This split up of the density Quctuations corresponds to an effective separation of the Coulomb interaction into long-range and short-range parts; the separation occurs at roughly the Debye length. The relation between the individual and collective aspects of the electron gas is discussed in detail, and a general physical picture of the behavior of the system is given. It is shown that for phenomena involving distances greater than the Debye length, the system behaves collectively; for distances shorter than this length, it may be treated as a collection of approximately free individual particles, whose interactions may be described in terms of two-body collisions. This approach is used to study the interaction of a specihed electron with the remainder of the electron gas. It is shown that the collective part of the response of this remainder to the Geld of the speciGed particle screens this Geld within a distance of the order of the Debye length; this furnishes a detailed description of the screening process. Moreover, if the speciGed particle moves with greater than the mean thermal speed, it excites collective oscillations in the form of a wake trailing the particle. The fre-quency of these collective oscillations and the energy emitted by the particle are calculated. A correspondence theoretical method is used to treat this phenomenon for the electrons in a metal. The results are in good agreement with the experiments of Ruthemann and Lying on the energy loss of kilovolt electrons in this metallic Glms. The generalization of these methods to an arbitrary inter-particle force is carried out, and a criterion is obtained for the validity of a collective description of the particle interactions. It is shown that strong forces and high particle density favor col-lective behavior, while high random the'rmal velocities oppose it. L INTRODUCTION N this paper we wish to develop a detailed physical --picture of the behavior of the electrons in a dense electron gas. We do this with the aid of a collective description of the particle motion. In a previous paper, hereafter referred to as I, we used a collective descrip-tion in treating the organized behavior of the electrons resulting from the transverse electromagnetic inter-actions. This was done by means of a canonical trans-formation to a set of collective coordinates which were appropriate for a description of the organized behavior. In the present paper, we are concerned with the or-ganization produced by the Coulomb interactions, which are far more important quantitatively than the trans-verse electromagnetic interactions. We stress the physical picture of thc clcctI'on bchRV1OI' helc bccRusc it is essential for the proper development and under-standing of the necessary mathematical formulation. In a subsequent paper we shall extend our results to the quantum theory by developing the canonical trans™ formation for the Coulomb case in a manner similar to that given in I. In a dense electron gas, the particles interact strongly because of the long range of the Coulomb force; in fact, each particle interacts simultaneously with all the other ' D. Bohm and D. Pines, Phys. Rev. 82, 62$ (t9$t). particles. As a result the equations of motion become extremely diKcult to solve. The usual perturbation theory solution based on the assumption of a small 1nteI'Rctlon bctwccn pai1s of pRrtlclcs bI'cRks down. As was the case in I, a collective description provides a far better starting point for a solution than a description in terms of the individual particles. For the collective description makes possible a simple method of treating the simultaneous interaction ot many electrons (as opposed to the individual particles approach which gives a simple method ot treating two-body collisions). Certain examples of collective behavior in an electron gas are well known from the study of gaseous discharges. These are the organized oscillations of the system as a whole, the "plasma" oscillations. 2 3 These oscillations have been studied theoretically with the simplifying assumption that the gas is composed of a distribution of beams of charge, each beam having a well-de6ned velocity at each, point in space. &$\sim$ This approach, although it gives many useful and instructive results concerning the oscillations, represents an excessive ab-straction which is not capable of describing many other important aspects of the organized behavior in the gas. (1949);Paper A discusses the origin of medium-like behavior, and gives many references to the earlier work on plasma oscillations; Paper B deals with the excitation and damping of oscillations. 338 In this paper we start with a gas of interacting point electrons. Instead of following the motion of the individual particles, we describe the gas in terms of the Fourier components of the electron density at each point in space. These Fourier components are propor'&i$\sim$ nal to the density fluctuations in the electron gas. We find that the density Quctuations can bc split into two parts. One part represents an organized oscillation with the characteristic "plasma" frequency, and is clearly associated with the collective behavior of the system. The other part is associated with the random thermal motion of the individual particles, and shows no col-lective behavior. For wavelengths greater than a certain critical length Xn (the Debye length), the fluctuations are primarily collective. When this is the case a descrip-tion of the behavior of the electrons solely in terms of their collective motion is a good approximation. For wavelengths smaller than) g), however, the fluctuations are primarily associated with individual particle motion, and in this case the system is best described by following the -individual paxticles. We use the above split-up of the density fluctuations to study the collective response of the electron gas to the held of an individual charged particle moving with a speci6ed velocity, vo. When vo is less than the mean thermal speed of the gas, we find that the collective response is just such as to screen out the 6eld of the specified particle within a distance of order of)$\sim$. When vo is greater than the mean thermal speed, a similar screening occurs, but in addition a new phenomenon appears: vis. , the excitation of collective oscillations in the form of a wake trailing the particle. The phenomenon resembles the Cerenkov radiation produced by fast electrons in dielectric materials. Experiments by Ruthemann and Lang, on the bombardment of thin metallic films by fast electrons tend to verify our theoretical predictions concerning this type of excitation of collective oscillations. ' $\sim$ On the basis of the above results we are led to the following physical picture of the screening process. As any electron moves through the assembly, the other electrons are pushed. away from it by the Coulomb repulsion. Each particle is thus surrounded by a cloud of extent X$\sim$, in which there is a deficiency of electrons, which is responsible for screening the field of the particle in question. As a result of this screening, the cross section for interparticle collision is so greatly reduced that the mean-free path of an electron is con-siderably greater than the interparticle spacing. Thus for many purposes the electron plus its associated cloud may be xegarded as an CGective free particle. Tllc splitup of the density Quctuatlon 1nto collcctivc and individual particles components may be viewed in the following way. The collective part includes the CGects of the long range of the Coulomb foxcc which leads to the simultaneous interact;on of many particles. 6 G. Ruthemann, Ann phys. 2, &&3 (&948)},

abstract = {We use a band unfolding technique to recover an effective primitive cell picture of the band structure of graphene under the influence of different types of perturbations. This involves intrinsic perturbations, such as structural defects, and external ones, comprising nitrogen substitutions and the inclusion of graphene in adsorbed systems. In such cases, the band unfolding provides a reliable and efficient tool for quantitatively analyzing the effect of doping and defects on the electronic structure of graphene. We envision that this approach will become a standard method in the computational analysis of graphene's electronic structure in related systems.},

The magnitude of the thermal and resistive anomalies in the $2H$ polytypes indicates only a small fraction of the Fermi surface is involved in the CDW distortion. The transition from the normal to the incommensurate CDW state at ${T}_{0}$ is second order, while the transition to the commensurate CDW state at ${T}_{d}$ is first order. However, the heat capacity anomaly at ${T}_{0}$, especially in $2H\ensuremath{-}\mathrm{Ta}{\mathrm{Se}}_{2}$, does not show the simple BCS-like jump expected from Landau models, rather a peak in the heat capacity occurs at ${T}_{0}$.},

The model effectiveness is demonstrated on a ZnO powder pattern exhibiting strongly anisotropic size broadening and pronounced super-Lorentzian peak shapes. Moreover, it is shown how the apparent crystallites can be interpreted in terms of physical models by using ellipsoidal and cylindrical crystallites with lognormal size distributions. This interpretation is critically assessed and it is argued that both simplified physical models and a priori complementary information (obtained by transmission electron microscopy, for instance) are often needed to avoid unstable and non-unique solutions.},

There is a closely related, precise notion of chiral-spin-liquid states. We construct soluble models, based on P- and T-symmetric local-spin Hamiltonians, with chiral-spin ground states. Mean-field theories leading to chiral spin liquids are proposed. Frustration is essential in stabilizing these states. The quantum numbers of quasiparticles around the chiral spin liquids are analyzed. They generally obey fractional statistics. Based on these ideas, it is speculated that superconducting states with unusual values of the flux quantum may exist.},

Recent x-ray scattering experiments in YBa2Cu3O(6+x) observe incommensurate charge-density wave fluctuations whose strength rises gradually over a wide temperature range above Tc, but then decreases as the temperature is lowered below Tc. We propose a theory in which the superconducting and charge-density wave orders exhibit angular fluctuations in a six-dimensional space. The theory provides a natural quantitative fit to the x-ray data and can be a basis for understanding other characteristics of the pseudogap.},

@article{Davis2013,
abstract = {Unconventional superconductivity (SC) is said to occur when Cooper pair formation is dominated by repulsive electron-electron interactions, so that the symmetry of the pair wave function is other than an isotropic s-wave. The strong, on-site, repulsive electron-electron interactions that are the proximate cause of such SC are more typically drivers of commensurate magnetism. Indeed, it is the suppression of commensurate antiferromagnetism (AF) that usually allows this type of unconventional superconductivity to emerge. Importantly, however, intervening between these AF and SC phases, intertwined electronic ordered phases (IP) of an unexpected nature are frequently discovered. For this reason, it has been extremely difficult to distinguish the microscopic essence of the correlated superconductivity from the often spectacular phenomenology of the IPs. Here we introduce a model conceptual framework within which to understand the relationship between AF electron-electron interactions, IPs, and correlated SC. We demonstrate its effectiveness in simultaneously explaining the consequences of AF interactions for the copper-based, iron-based, and heavy-fermion superconductors, as well as for their quite distinct IPs.},

abstract = {A wide variety of experimental results and theoretical investigations in recent years have convincingly demonstrated that several transition metal oxides and other materials have dominant states that are not spatially homogeneous. This occurs in cases in which several physical interactions-spin, charge, lattice, and/or orbital-are simultaneously active. This phenomenon causes interesting effects, such as colossal magnetoresistance, and it also appears crucial to understand the high-temperature superconductors. The spontaneous emergence of electronic nanometer-scale structures in transition metal oxides, and the existence of many competing states, are properties often associated with complex matter where nonlinearities dominate, such as soft materials and biological systems. This electronic complexity could have potential consequences for applications of correlated electronic materials, because not only charge (semiconducting electronic), or charge and spin (spintronics) are of relevance, but in addition the lattice and orbital degrees of freedom are active, leading to giant responses to small perturbations. Moreover, several metallic and insulating phases compete, increasing the potential for novel behavior.},

@article{Romaniello2009,
abstract = {It is commonly accepted that the GW approximation for the electron self-energy is successful for the description of the band structure of weakly to moderately correlated systems, whereas it will fail for strongly correlated materials. In the present work, we discuss two important aspects of this approximation: first, the "self-screening error," which is due to an incorrect treatment of induced exchange, and second, the atomic limit, in which, instead, correlation is directly responsible for the observed problem. Using the example of the removal of a particle from a box, we show that the self-screening error stems from the use of test charge-test charge screening and that it can be corrected by a two-point vertex contribution to the self-energy derived from time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). We explain why the addition of a particle, instead, requires the use of a different approximate vertex. This illustrates why the general vertex function, valid both for valence and conduction states, must be a three-point function. Moreover, we show that also the bad performance of GW in the atomic limit is due to the neglect of the vertex in the self-energy; in that case, the TDDFT-derived vertex correction is not sufficient in order to remove the error even qualitatively. We discuss the effects of the self-screening error as well as the atomic limit using GW for the exactly solvable two-site Hubbard model.},

abstract = {A versatile method for combining density functional theory (DFT) in the local density approximation (LDA) with dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) is presented. Starting from a general basis-independent formulation, we use Wannier functions as an interface between the two theories. These functions are used for the physical purpose of identifying the correlated orbitals in a specific material, and also for the more technical purpose of interfacing DMFT with different kinds of band-structure methods (with three different techniques being used in the present work). We explore and compare two distinct Wannier schemes, namely the maximally-localized-Wannier-function (MLWF) and the $N$-th order muffin-tin-orbital (NMTO) methods. Two correlated materials with different degrees of structural and electronic complexity, SrVO3 and BaVS3, are investigated as case studies. SrVO3 belongs to the canonical class of correlated transition-metal oxides, and is chosen here as a test case in view of its simple structure and physical properties. In contrast, the sulfide BaVS3 is known for its rich and complex physics, associated with strong correlation effects and low-dimensional characteristics. New insights into the physics associated with the metal-insulator transition of this compound are provided, particularly regarding correlation-induced modifications of its Fermi surface. Additionally, the necessary formalism for implementing self-consistency over the electronic charge density in a Wannier basis is discussed.},

We show that both the collapse of the insulating gap and the concomitant change in crystal symmetry in homogeneously strained single-crystalline VO2 films are preceded by the purely-electronic softening of Coulomb correlations within V-V singlet dimers. This process starts 7 K (+/- 0.3 K) below the transition temperature, as conventionally defined by electronic transport and x-ray diffraction measurements, and sets the energy scale for driving the near-room-temperature insulator-metal transition in this technologically-promising material.},

abstract = {Optical excitation of apical oxygen vibrations in YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6+\delta}$ has been shown to enhance its c-axis superconducting-phase rigidity, as evidenced by a transient blue shift of the equilibrium inter-bilayer Josephson plasma resonance. Surprisingly, a transient c-axis plasma mode could also be induced above T$_{c}$ by the same apical oxygen excitation, suggesting light activated superfluid tunneling throughout the pseudogap phase of YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6+\delta}$. However, despite the similarities between the above T$_{c}$ transient plasma mode and the equilibrium Josephson plasmon, alternative explanations involving high mobility quasiparticle transport should be considered. Here, we report an extensive study of the relaxation of the light-induced plasmon into the equilibrium incoherent phase. These new experiments allow for a critical assessment of the nature of this mode. We determine that the transient plasma relaxes through a collapse of its coherence length rather than its carrier (or superfluid) density. These observations are not easily reconciled with quasiparticle interlayer transport, and rather support transient superfluid tunneling as the origin of the light-induced interlayer coupling in YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6+\delta}$.},
